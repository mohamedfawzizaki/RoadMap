CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**. It's a modern DevOps practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

## 🔁 **1. Continuous Integration (CI)**

### 📌 **Definition**:

Continuous Integration is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, ideally several times a day. Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests.

### 🔧 **Core Components**:

* **Source Code Repository** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
* **CI Server** (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI)
* **Automated Tests** (unit, integration, static analysis)
* **Build Automation** (compiling, packaging, linting, etc.)

### 🔄 **Typical CI Workflow**:

1. **Developer pushes code** → Git `push` to a shared branch (e.g., `develop`, `main`).
2. **CI server triggers** on push or pull request.
3. **Steps executed**:

   * Checkout code
   * Install dependencies
   * Run linters (e.g., ESLint, PHPStan)
   * Run unit/integration tests
   * Build the application (optional)

### ✅ **Benefits**:

* Early bug detection
* Fast feedback
* Code quality enforcement
* Integration problems caught early

## 🚀 **2. Continuous Delivery (CD)**

### 📌 **Definition**:

Continuous Delivery ensures that the codebase is always in a **deployable state**, and deployment to staging or production is **automated**, but **manually triggered**.

### 🔄 **Typical CD Workflow**:

1. **CI passes** → trigger CD pipeline.
2. **Package the app** → e.g., `.jar`, `.zip`, Docker image.
3. **Push to artifact registry** → e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, AWS ECR.
4. **Deploy to staging** environment.
5. (Optional) Manual approval → deploy to production.

### 📂 **Common Tools**:

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform, CloudFormation
* **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Chef
* **Deployment Platforms**: Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Heroku, Azure, Firebase

## ⚙️ **3. Continuous Deployment (CD)**

### 📌 **Definition**:

Continuous Deployment extends Continuous Delivery by automatically **deploying every change that passes CI** to production **without manual intervention**.

### 🚨 **Requirements**:

* Very high test coverage
* Robust monitoring and rollback systems
* Feature flags to control visibility of incomplete features

### 🔁 **Example CD Flow**:

1. Developer pushes code
2. CI runs tests and builds
3. CD deploys new version automatically to production

## 📘 **CI/CD Example: GitHub Actions + Docker + AWS**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build Docker Image
      run: docker build -t myapp:latest .

    - name: Push to Docker Hub
      run: |
        echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
        docker tag myapp:latest mydockerhubuser/myapp:latest
        docker push mydockerhubuser/myapp:latest

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: aws ecs update-service --cluster my-cluster --service my-service --force-new-deployment
```

## 🧩 **Best Practices**:

* Keep pipelines fast (under 10 minutes ideal)
* Use feature flags to release incomplete features
* Use canary deployments or blue-green deployments
* Secure secrets using a vault or CI/CD secrets manager
* Monitor builds and deployments with alerts/logs
* Rollback mechanism for failed deployments

## 🧠 Summary Table:

| **Stage**              | **Focus**                    | **Automated?**        | **Trigger**     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| Continuous Integration | Build + Test code            | ✅ Yes                 | Code push/PR    |
| Continuous Delivery    | Prepare for deployment       | ✅ Yes (Manual Deploy) | After CI passes |
| Continuous Deployment  | Automatic deployment to prod | ✅ Fully automated     | After CI passes |
