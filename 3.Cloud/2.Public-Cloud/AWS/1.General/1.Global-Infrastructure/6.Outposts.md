#                                             **AWS Outposts** 

## üîç What is AWS **Outposts**?

**AWS Outposts** is a **fully managed infrastructure offering** that extends **AWS services, APIs, and tools** **into your on-premises data center** or **co-location facility**. It's designed for workloads that require:

* **Low latency** to on-prem systems
* **Local data processing**
* **Data residency**
* **Edge computing**
* **Hybrid cloud deployments**

> üß† Think of Outposts as:
> **AWS-in-a-box**, physically installed **in your facility**, but **managed by AWS**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How Outposts Works (Architecture)

AWS delivers and installs **rack-mount hardware** at your location:

* Contains **compute, storage, and networking**
* Connected to your **local LAN**
* Managed and updated via the **AWS control plane**

Your Outpost connects securely to the **nearest AWS Region**, using a **redundant connection** (Direct Connect or VPN over the Internet).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Deploy Outposts

### 1. **Order and Install**

* Use AWS Console to configure and order your Outpost:

  * Size (e.g. 1U, 2U, 42U rack)
  * Capacity (EC2 instance types, EBS volume sizes)
  * Network setup (public/private IPs, bandwidth)
* AWS ships, installs, and activates the Outpost

### 2. **Connect**

* Outpost connects to AWS Region via:

  * VPN (IPSec)
  * AWS Direct Connect (preferred)
* Create a **Service Link** back to AWS Region

### 3. **Launch Resources**

* Use AWS Console/CLI to launch EC2, ECS, RDS, etc. ‚Äî **just like in the cloud**
* Select the **Outpost Availability Zone** (e.g. `us-east-1-outpost-xyz`)
