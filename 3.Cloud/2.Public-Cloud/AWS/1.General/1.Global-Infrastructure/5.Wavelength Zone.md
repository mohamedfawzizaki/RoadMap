#                                       **AWS Wavelength Zones**

## 🔍 What Is an AWS **Wavelength Zone**?

An **AWS Wavelength Zone** is a special type of AWS infrastructure that brings **compute and storage services** *directly into the data centers of telecom (5G) providers* — placing them at the **very edge of mobile networks**.

### 🚀 Goal:

To enable applications (like AR/VR, real-time gaming, autonomous vehicles) to **run at ultra-low latency** (as low as **1–10 milliseconds**) — **much faster** than traditional cloud deployments.

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

Wavelength Zones embed **AWS infrastructure inside a 5G provider’s data center** (e.g., Verizon, Vodafone, SK Telecom).

```plaintext
User → 5G Base Station → Telecom Core → AWS Wavelength Zone → AWS Region (if needed)
```

### Layers of Access:

1. **Device** connects to the **5G network**
2. Request is **routed to Wavelength Zone** (bypasses Internet)
3. App executes on **EC2 in Wavelength Zone**
4. For deeper processing/storage, request may go to the **parent AWS Region**

## 🧬 Architecture Comparison

| Infrastructure      | Location                 | Latency    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| AWS Region          | Large geographic area    | 30–100+ ms |
| AWS Local Zone      | Metro city close to user | 5–20 ms    |
| AWS Wavelength Zone | Inside 5G network        | **<10 ms** |

| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment**     | EC2, EBS, VPC within the 5G network                           |
| **Parent Region**  | Control plane resides in nearby AWS Region                    |
| **Private Subnet** | Deployed apps are reachable directly from 5G devices          |
| **Latency**        | As low as **1–5 ms** (edge-to-app round trip)                 |
| **Security**       | All traffic stays on AWS backbone unless configured otherwise |
