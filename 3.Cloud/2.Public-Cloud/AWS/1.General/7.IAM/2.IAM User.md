#                                      👤 AWS IAM Users

## 📌 What Is an IAM User?

An **IAM (Identity and Access Management) User** is an **identity within your AWS account** that represents a **person or an application** that needs to **interact with AWS services directly**.

Each IAM user can have:

* **Credentials** (username/password or access keys)
* **Permissions** (via policies)
* **Security controls** (like MFA, password policies)

> ✅ IAM Users are **created by the root user or an admin** and should never be confused with the root account itself.

## 🧩 Key Components of an IAM User

| Component       | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User Name**   | Unique identifier within the AWS account                                 |
| **Password**    | For AWS Console access                                                   |
| **Access Keys** | For programmatic access via CLI/SDK (consists of Access Key ID & Secret) |
| **Permissions** | Attached using **IAM policies** (inline or managed)                      |
| **Tags**        | Key-value pairs used for access control or tracking                      |
| **MFA**         | Multi-Factor Authentication can be enabled for extra security            |

## 🧠 What Can IAM Users Do?

IAM users can be granted permission to:

* Access specific **AWS services** (S3, EC2, etc.)
* Create or manage **resources**
* Run **CLI/API calls**
* View **CloudWatch logs**, dashboards, etc.
* Deploy **infrastructure as code** (e.g. via Terraform or CDK)

---

## 🧱 How IAM Users Work

### Types of Access:

1. **AWS Management Console**

   * Requires a **username and password**
   * Optional: **MFA**
2. **AWS CLI/SDK/Tools**

   * Requires an **Access Key ID + Secret Access Key**
   * Optional: **session tokens or roles**

## 🔐 IAM User Security Best Practices

| Practice                                | Why It's Important                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 **Enable MFA**                       | Adds a second layer of protection                           |
| 🔐 **Do NOT use access keys long-term** | Use roles or session tokens where possible                  |
| 🔁 **Rotate access keys regularly**     | Prevents stale credentials from being compromised           |
| 🧾 **Use least privilege**              | Users should only have the permissions they absolutely need |
| 📜 **Use managed policies**             | Easier to maintain and audit                                |
| 👥 **Assign users to groups**           | Apply permissions via groups for scalability                |
| 👣 **Monitor with CloudTrail**          | Track user activity and detect suspicious behavior          |

## ⚙️ Creating an IAM User (via Console)

1. Go to **IAM → Users → Add user**
2. Provide a **user name**
3. Choose **access type**:

   * ✅ Console access
   * ✅ Programmatic access
4. Assign **permissions**:

   * Add user to group (preferred)
   * Copy from existing user
   * Attach policies directly
5. (Optional) Add **tags**
6. Review and create
7. Download or copy **credentials securely**

## 🚫 IAM User vs. IAM Role

| Feature       | IAM User                            | IAM Role                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Identity Type | Persistent identity                 | Temporary, assumed identity          |
| Use Case      | Humans with long-term access        | Services, apps, federated users      |
| Credentials   | Permanent (unless rotated manually) | Temporary (STS tokens, auto-rotated) |
| Security Risk | Higher (if misconfigured)           | Lower (if used properly)             |

---

## 🧰 Example Use Cases for IAM Users

* DevOps engineer needs console and CLI access
* Auditor needs read-only access to CloudTrail and Config
* Support engineer needs permission to view S3 logs
* Small team of developers with limited admin permissions

For large enterprises or teams:

> 🔄 **Federated access (SSO or IAM Identity Center)** is preferred over managing many IAM users.

## 🗑️ When to Avoid IAM Users

Avoid creating IAM users when:

* You're dealing with a **large organization** – prefer **IAM Identity Center (SSO)**
* The access is **temporary or programmatic** – use **IAM roles**
* You’re automating deployments – use **CI/CD roles or instance profiles**

---

## 🧠 IAM User Limitations

* Maximum of **5,000 users per AWS account**
* Each user can have:

  * **2 active access keys**
  * **1 console password**
* No built-in session expiration like roles
* Each access key must be **manually rotated** and stored securely
* Hard to scale without automation

---

## 🛡️ IAM User + Group Strategy (Best Practice)

1. Create **IAM groups** like:

   * `Developers`
   * `Admins`
   * `Billing`
   * `Auditors`
2. Attach appropriate **managed policies** to groups
3. Add users to groups (don’t attach policies directly)
4. Use **IAM Access Analyzer** + **CloudTrail** to monitor usage
5. Regularly audit with **IAM Credential Reports**

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature        | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| IAM User       | Permanent identity for human or system use              |
| Authentication | Username/password (console), Access Keys (CLI/SDK)      |
| Authorization  | IAM policies (inline, managed, customer or AWS managed) |
| Best Practice  | Use groups, enforce MFA, rotate keys, least privilege   |
| Alternatives   | IAM roles (temporary), IAM Identity Center (SSO)        |
