## üìå What Is IAM Identity Center?

**IAM Identity Center** is a **cloud-based identity management service** from AWS that enables you to:

* **Centrally manage access** across multiple AWS accounts
* **Integrate external identity providers** (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace)
* Provide **SSO (Single Sign-On)** to AWS Console and other business applications
* Use **fine-grained permission sets** for users and groups
* Replace traditional IAM users in favor of **identity-based federation**

> IAM Identity Center is the **recommended way** to manage workforce access in AWS Organizations.

## üß± Key Concepts

| Component          | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**           | A human identity (created in the IAM Identity Center or synchronized from an IdP) |
| **Group**          | A collection of users (used to manage access in bulk)                             |
| **Permission Set** | A template of IAM policies used to assign access to AWS accounts or apps          |
| **Assignment**     | The link between **user/group ‚Üî permission set ‚Üî account/application**            |
| **SSO Portal**     | The user-facing dashboard for launching accounts and apps securely                |

---

## üß† How It Works

1. Admin connects IAM Identity Center to:

   * AWS accounts (via Organizations)
   * Applications (SAML or OIDC)
   * Optionally: External identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, etc.)

2. Admin defines **permission sets** (e.g., billing admin, EC2 admin)

3. Admin assigns users or groups ‚Üí to **accounts or apps** using permission sets

4. User logs in to the **SSO portal** ‚Üí chooses account ‚Üí assumes a **role** ‚Üí accesses AWS

---

## üß≠ Identity Source Options

You can configure IAM Identity Center to use:

| Source                        | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identity Center directory** | Built-in user store (local users and groups)                         |
| **Active Directory (AD)**     | Via AWS Directory Service (AD Connector or AWS Managed AD)           |
| **External IdP** (OIDC/SAML)  | Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace, Ping Identity, etc. via federation |

---

## üîê Permission Sets

A **permission set** is a reusable policy template that IAM Identity Center uses to create and manage IAM roles in accounts.

* Can contain:

  * **Managed policies** (AWS or customer-managed)
  * **Inline policies**
  * **Session duration**
  * **Tags**

Example use cases:

* `ReadOnlyAccess` to dev accounts
* `PowerUserAccess` for engineering teams
* `BillingAccess` for finance

---

## üöÄ SSO Portal Experience

When a user logs in to the IAM Identity Center user portal:

* They see **all assigned AWS accounts and apps**
* For each account, they choose a **role (permission set)** to assume
* The switch is seamless ‚Äî no long-term IAM credentials required

---

## üì¶ Application SSO Integration

IAM Identity Center can act as the **identity provider** (IdP) for cloud applications using **SAML 2.0 or OIDC**.

Popular integrations:

* **Salesforce**
* **Office 365**
* **Zoom**
* **Slack**
* **GitHub**
* Any SAML 2.0-enabled app

## üîÑ Comparison: IAM Identity Center vs Traditional IAM Users

| Feature                 | IAM Identity Center             | IAM Users                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Credential type         | Temporary (federated)           | Long-term static access keys               |
| Central management      | Across all accounts             | Per account only                           |
| MFA support             | Built-in, enforced per identity | Manual setup per user                      |
| SSO capability          | Yes                             | No                                         |
| External IdP support    | Yes (SAML, OIDC)                | Only via IAM federation or custom STS flow |
| Rotation & auditability | Easier via roles & federation   | Harder with static keys                    |
| Recommended use         | For workforce access (humans)   | For programmatic access (e.g., CI/CD apps) |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Workflow (Federated Login with Azure AD)

1. Admin connects **Azure AD** as external identity source
2. Users in Azure AD are synced into IAM Identity Center groups
3. Permission sets are assigned to those groups for specific AWS accounts
4. Azure AD user logs in via their company portal and is redirected to AWS console with SSO
5. They assume an IAM role generated by IAM Identity Center

---

## üß™ Auditing and Logs

* **CloudTrail** tracks all IAM Identity Center actions
* **Access logs** can be sent to CloudWatch or S3
* You can analyze:

  * Who accessed which account and when
  * What permission set they used
  * What apps they launched

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

‚úÖ Always **enforce MFA** for users
‚úÖ Use **external IdPs** for lifecycle management (hire ‚Üí fire)
‚úÖ Replace long-term IAM credentials with **federated access**
‚úÖ Assign access via **groups**, not individuals
‚úÖ Use **least privilege permission sets**
‚úÖ Regularly audit **assignments and sessions**

---

## üìä Pricing

* IAM Identity Center is **free**
* You only pay for:

  * AWS Directory Service (if used)
  * The underlying resources accessed (e.g., EC2, S3, etc.)
