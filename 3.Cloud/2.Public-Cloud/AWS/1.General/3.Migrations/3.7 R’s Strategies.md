#                                  7 R‚Äôs of Cloud Migration Strategies               


The **7 R‚Äôs of Cloud Migration Strategies** are a set of approaches organizations can use to move applications to the cloud. These strategies help determine the best path forward based on technical complexity, business value, and modernization goals.

---

## 1. üõ´ **Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)**

### What it is:

Move applications **as-is** from on-premises to the cloud without modifying the code or architecture.

### When to use:

* You need to migrate quickly with minimal risk.
* You want to exit a data center fast (e.g., contract expiry).
* You‚Äôre new to the cloud and want to learn with less complexity.

### Benefits:

* Fast and low-cost migration.
* Little to no code changes.
* Ideal for legacy systems with stable workloads.

### Limitations:

* You don‚Äôt gain full cloud benefits (like scalability or elasticity).
* Long-term cost savings may be limited.

### Tools:

* AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
* AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
* AWS VM Import/Export

---

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è **Replatform (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**

### What it is:

Move to the cloud with **small modifications** to optimize performance, cost, or operations ‚Äî but without changing the core architecture.

### When to use:

* You want some cloud benefits without full refactoring.
* You need to change OS, middleware, or database.
* You want to adopt managed services like RDS or Elastic Beanstalk.

### Benefits:

* Improved performance and reduced maintenance.
* Partial modernization without high complexity.
* Easy to scale and integrate with other cloud services.

### Limitations:

* Still constrained by legacy architecture.
* Not fully cloud-native.

### Examples:

* Move SQL Server on EC2 to Amazon RDS.
* Replace a local message broker with Amazon SQS.

---

## 3. üí≥ **Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**

### What it is:

Replace the current application with a **commercial SaaS** solution.

### When to use:

* Your current app is outdated or too expensive to maintain.
* You want to avoid managing infrastructure completely.
* There‚Äôs a suitable SaaS replacement available.

### Benefits:

* Quick to adopt with minimal migration effort.
* Removes infrastructure and software maintenance burden.
* Predictable pricing and rapid feature delivery.

### Limitations:

* Potential data migration complexity.
* Less customization or vendor lock-in.
* Change management required for end-users.

### Examples:

* Replace on-prem email system with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace.
* Replace CRM with Salesforce.
* Move to Workday for HR.

---

## 4. üèóÔ∏è **Refactor / Rearchitect**

### What it is:

**Redesign the application** to take full advantage of cloud-native features such as microservices, serverless, event-driven design, and containers.

### When to use:

* Your application needs to scale dynamically.
* You want to improve agility, resilience, and performance.
* You want to break monoliths into microservices.

### Benefits:

* Full use of cloud elasticity, resilience, and automation.
* Better developer velocity and DevOps alignment.
* Long-term cost optimization and innovation.

### Limitations:

* High complexity and cost.
* Requires significant time and skilled teams.
* Testing and data migration challenges.

### Examples:

* Break a monolith into AWS Lambda functions or ECS microservices.
* Replace traditional authentication with Amazon Cognito.

---

## 5. üóëÔ∏è **Retire**

### What it is:

**Decommission** or phase out applications that are no longer needed.

### When to use:

* The app is redundant, obsolete, or underutilized.
* It‚Äôs cheaper to remove it than to migrate it.
* It has low business value.

### Benefits:

* Immediate cost savings.
* Reduced complexity in the migration landscape.

### Limitations:

* Must validate dependencies before removal.
* May require change management and stakeholder approval.

### Tips:

* Look for shadow IT, test environments, old reporting tools, etc.

---

## 6. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Retain (Revisit Later)**

### What it is:

Keep the application **on-premises or as-is** for now.

### When to use:

* Regulatory or latency constraints prevent cloud migration.
* You‚Äôre not ready to prioritize the workload.
* The app requires refactoring before cloud-readiness.

### Benefits:

* Allows more time for planning or modernization.
* Avoids forcing poor cloud fits.

### Limitations:

* Can delay modernization.
* Still requires on-prem maintenance and support.

### Strategy:

* Reevaluate in future migration waves.

---

## 7. üöö **Relocate (VM Transfer Without Changes)**

### What it is:

Move **VMs and applications to cloud-native infrastructure** (like VMware Cloud on AWS) without changing anything ‚Äî not even IP addresses or configurations.

### When to use:

* You want fast migration but need to keep VMware or other hypervisors.
* You have large, tightly coupled legacy applications.
* You‚Äôre doing a data center evacuation and want ‚Äúlift-and-shift at scale.‚Äù

### Benefits:

* Extremely fast migration with no refactoring.
* Supports legacy architectures temporarily.
* Maintains operational continuity.

### Limitations:

* Not modernized; often a temporary state.
* May result in higher cloud costs long-term.

### Tools:

* VMware Cloud on AWS
* AWS Outposts
