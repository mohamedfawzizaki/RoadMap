#                                          AWS Migration Tools


Here‚Äôs a **deep dive into AWS Migration Tools**, categorized by their purpose and migration phase. These tools help you plan, execute, track, and optimize your migration to AWS‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre moving servers, databases, applications, or entire data centers.


## üîç 1. **Assessment & Discovery Tools**

These tools help you **inventory your existing environment**, assess migration readiness, and build a **business case** for cloud adoption.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Migration Evaluator (formerly TSO Logic)

**Purpose:** Estimate AWS TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) and create business cases.

* Collects utilization data from existing on-prem servers.
* Compares costs vs. cloud alternatives.
* Helps you right-size EC2 and storage options.
* Provides detailed recommendations on instance types and pricing models.

> Ideal for CFOs and architects evaluating cost benefits.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Application Discovery Service

**Purpose:** Discover and map servers, apps, dependencies, and usage patterns.

* Automatically collects metadata and network activity.
* Helps identify app dependencies before migration.
* Supports agent-based and agentless discovery.
* Integrates with Migration Hub for visualization.

> Critical for complex environments with interconnected workloads.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA)

**Purpose:** Evaluate your organization's cloud readiness.

* Structured assessment based on AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).
* Evaluates across six perspectives: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations.
* Identifies gaps and action plans.

---

## üìä 2. **Migration Planning & Tracking**

These tools let you **coordinate and track the migration** process centrally.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Migration Hub

**Purpose:** Central dashboard to monitor and track migrations.

* Tracks server, database, and application migrations in real time.
* Integrates with AWS tools (MGN, DMS) and some third-party tools.
* Shows status, wave groups, and timelines.

> Think of it as your **command center** during a migration project.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Migration Hub Refactor Spaces

**Purpose:** Manage microservices refactoring for legacy applications.

* Enables iterative decomposition of monolithic applications into microservices.
* Integrates with API Gateway, Lambda, ECS, and more.
* Creates environments for safe refactoring.

> Useful for advanced **refactor/re-architect strategies**.

---

## üöö 3. **Application & Server Migration Tools**

These are the primary tools for **lifting and shifting** VMs and servers to AWS.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)

**Purpose:** Lift-and-shift entire servers with minimal downtime.

* Converts physical, virtual, or cloud-based servers to EC2.
* Continuous block-level replication.
* Non-disruptive testing and automated cutover.
* Supports Windows, Linux, VMware, Hyper-V, and more.

> Replaces older tools like CloudEndure and AWS SMS.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) *(Legacy)*

**Purpose:** Migrate on-prem virtual machines to AWS.

* Agentless replication of VMs (Hyper-V or VMware).
* Creates Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).
* Works best for small-scale migrations.

> Deprecated in favor of MGN.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Snow Family (Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile)

**Purpose:** Migrate large-scale data when network transfer is impractical.

* **Snowcone** (8 TB): Portable, rugged device.
* **Snowball** (50‚Äì80 TB): Encrypted, secure device with edge compute.
* **Snowmobile** (100 PB): Semi-truck-sized device for full data center migrations.

> Used when data volumes are **too large** for practical internet transfer.

---

## üß© 4. **Database Migration Tools**

These tools help you migrate **databases to AWS** with minimal downtime.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

**Purpose:** Migrate relational and NoSQL databases to AWS.

* Supports homogeneous (e.g., Oracle ‚Üí Oracle) and heterogeneous (e.g., SQL Server ‚Üí Aurora) migrations.
* Continuous replication, minimal downtime.
* Built-in schema conversion and validation.

> Often used with Schema Conversion Tool (SCT).

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

**Purpose:** Convert database schema and code to AWS-compatible formats.

* Translates SQL queries, stored procedures, and functions.
* Identifies schema incompatibilities.
* Works with DMS for schema + data migration.

> Essential for **heterogeneous migrations** like Oracle ‚Üí PostgreSQL.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 5. **Hybrid & Edge Migration Tools**

These tools are used to **bridge on-premises and cloud**, or extend the cloud to your edge.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Outposts

**Purpose:** Bring AWS services on-premises.

* Run EC2, EBS, RDS, ECS, EKS, and S3 locally.
* Use same APIs and tools as in AWS.
* Ideal for latency-sensitive or regulatory workloads.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Storage Gateway

**Purpose:** Bridge on-prem apps to AWS cloud storage.

* File, volume, or tape-based gateways.
* Backup directly to Amazon S3 or Glacier.
* Seamless integration with existing NFS, SMB, and iSCSI workloads.

---

### ‚úÖ AWS Direct Connect

**Purpose:** Dedicated network connection from data center to AWS.

* Lower latency, consistent performance vs. VPN.
* Good for data-intensive workloads or hybrid scenarios.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 6. **Security & Governance Tools for Migration**

Ensure your cloud environment is **secure, compliant, and well-managed** during and after migration.

* **AWS Control Tower** ‚Äì Sets up multi-account governance baseline.
* **AWS Organizations** ‚Äì Central billing, policies, account creation.
* **AWS IAM** ‚Äì Role-based access and permission boundaries.
* **AWS Config / Security Hub / GuardDuty** ‚Äì Security posture and compliance checks.
* **AWS CloudTrail** ‚Äì Tracks API activity for auditing.

---

## üìà 7. **Post-Migration Optimization Tools**

Tools for **cost management, performance tuning**, and long-term efficiency.

* **AWS Cost Explorer** ‚Äì Visualize usage and optimize cost.
* **AWS Compute Optimizer** ‚Äì Suggests EC2 size changes based on historical usage.
* **AWS Trusted Advisor** ‚Äì Recommends best practices (cost, security, performance).
* **AWS Well-Architected Tool** ‚Äì Performs architecture reviews.
