#                                          AWS Basic Support Plan

The **AWS Basic Support Plan** is the **default support plan** that comes **free of charge** with every AWS account. It’s designed for individuals, students, startups, and hobbyists who are learning or testing AWS services without needing dedicated technical support from AWS engineers.

---

## ✅ **Key Features**

### 1. **Cost**

* **Free** — included with all AWS accounts.
* No monthly fee, no additional charges.

---

### 2. **Documentation Access**

* Full access to:

  * **AWS product documentation**
  * **Whitepapers**
  * **FAQs**
  * **Best practice guides**
* Learn how to architect, deploy, secure, and manage AWS resources independently.

---

### 3. **AWS Support Forums**

* Access to the **AWS Developer Forums** to ask questions and get community support.
* AWS engineers and expert users sometimes respond, but **response time is not guaranteed**.

---

### 4. **AWS Trusted Advisor – Core Checks Only**

The Basic Support Plan provides **limited access to Trusted Advisor** — AWS’s recommendation engine that helps improve:

* Security
* Cost optimization
* Performance
* Fault tolerance
* Service limits

#### Core checks available under Basic Plan:

1. **Service Limits**: Warns if you're approaching AWS service quotas.
2. **Security Groups – Specific Ports Unrestricted**: Flags overly open security group rules (e.g., open SSH/RDP to world).
3. **IAM Use**: Recommends using individual IAM users instead of root account.
4. **MFA on Root Account**: Suggests enabling multi-factor authentication.
5. **EBS Public Snapshots**: Flags public snapshots that might expose data.
6. **S3 Bucket Permissions**: Warns about overly permissive public S3 buckets.
7. **RDS Public Snapshots**: Checks for publicly available RDS backups.

> Full access to all 100+ Trusted Advisor checks is only available in Business and Enterprise support plans.

---

### 5. **AWS Personal Health Dashboard**

* View the **health of AWS services** that impact your resources.
* Shows real-time alerts and historical data for:

  * EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.
  * Region-specific service issues
  * Scheduled maintenance that may affect your resources
* Provides **personalized view** based on your AWS usage.

---

### 6. **Billing & Account Support**

* Ability to open **support cases** for:

  * Billing questions
  * Payment inquiries
  * Account & quota issues

> These cases are handled via the AWS **Support Center**.

---

### 7. **Service Quota Increase Requests**

* You can request **quota increases** (e.g., more EC2 instances) through the AWS Support Center — even with Basic Support.

---

## ❌ **What You Do *Not* Get**

* **No access to AWS support engineers**
* **No technical support cases**
* **No phone, email, or live chat support**
* **No architectural guidance or best-practice reviews**
