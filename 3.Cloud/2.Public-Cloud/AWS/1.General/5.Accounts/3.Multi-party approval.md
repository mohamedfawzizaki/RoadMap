#                                         üîê AWS Multi-Party Approval (MPA)
#                           https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/what-is.html

**Multi-Party Approval (MPA)** is a **security control mechanism** that ensures **two or more people must approve** a sensitive action before it can be executed in AWS. It is designed to **reduce insider threats**, **increase accountability**, and **enforce separation of duties** in high-trust, high-risk environments (like finance, security, and compliance-focused industries).

---

## üß≠ What Is Multi-Party Approval?

MPA enforces that **no single person can unilaterally perform a sensitive operation** ‚Äî like:

* Deleting production resources
* Changing encryption keys
* Rotating security credentials
* Altering IAM roles or trust relationships
* Modifying SCPs or CloudTrail settings

It‚Äôs not a built-in AWS feature but rather a **pattern** implemented using **multiple AWS services**.

---

## üß© How to Implement Multi-Party Approval in AWS

There‚Äôs no checkbox labeled ‚ÄúEnable MPA,‚Äù but you can **build** MPA using a combination of:

### 1. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

* Restrict direct access to sensitive actions.
* Define a role that **cannot act without approval**.

---

### 2. **AWS Lambda + Step Functions (or EventBridge)**

* Trigger a **workflow** when a request is submitted.
* Pause until approvals are collected.
* Proceed or reject the action based on outcome.

---

### 3. **AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) / Amazon Chime / Slack**

* Notify approvers when an action is requested.

---

### 4. **AWS SSM (Systems Manager) Automation**

* Use **SSM Runbooks** with approval steps built-in.
* Example: `AWS-ApproveAndExecute` document requires an IAM user to approve the automation.

---

### 5. **AWS CloudTrail & CloudWatch**

* Track all actions.
* Detect unapproved or out-of-band changes.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Case Example: S3 Bucket Deletion

### Goal: Prevent a single admin from deleting a production S3 bucket

**Implementation:**

1. Deny `s3:DeleteBucket` directly in IAM
2. Create a **Lambda-backed approval system**:

   * Admin submits request via CLI or console
   * Event triggers **Step Function**
   * Step Function sends approval request via SNS
   * Two designated approvers must approve (via API Gateway UI or SSM)
   * Only then is the delete action executed
3. All actions are logged in **CloudTrail**
4. Alarms are sent for any unauthorized delete attempts

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

| Benefit                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‚úÖ Reduces Insider Threat Risk | No one person can execute high-risk actions alone            |
| ‚úÖ Enforces Governance         | Requires consensus for sensitive operations                  |
| ‚úÖ Enhances Auditability       | Approval trail logged and monitored                          |
| ‚úÖ Aligns with Compliance      | Meets requirements like **SOX**, **HIPAA**, **CIS**, **PCI** |
| ‚úÖ Supports DevSecOps          | Integrates with CI/CD and change workflows                   |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

| Challenge                   | Mitigation                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| No Native MPA Setting       | Must build the workflow using Lambda, SSM, etc.  |
| Added Latency in Operations | Offset with approval windows or automation tiers |
| Complex Policy Design       | Requires careful IAM + SCP + automation design   |
| Risk of Bypass              | Must deny direct access via IAM/SCP              |

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| IAM                 | Restrict sensitive actions and define approver roles   |
| SSM Automation      | Built-in support for approval steps                    |
| Step Functions      | Automate multi-step approval workflows                 |
| Lambda              | Custom logic and integration with approval APIs        |
| CloudTrail          | Audit every access and change attempt                  |
| EventBridge         | Trigger workflows on policy violations or user actions |
| SNS / Chime / Slack | Notify approvers                                       |
| AWS Organizations   | Apply SCPs to prevent direct bypasses                  |

## üß† Best Practices

* Always **deny direct access** to critical actions
* Require **two distinct roles** to approve actions (e.g., developer and auditor)
* Use **least privilege IAM design**
* Monitor with **CloudWatch Alarms** for any escalation attempts
* Log every action and **store logs cross-account** in a central audit account
* Use **MFA for all approvers**

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| What is it?             | Pattern requiring multiple people to approve actions |
| Native Feature?         | Not directly ‚Äì must be built with AWS services       |
