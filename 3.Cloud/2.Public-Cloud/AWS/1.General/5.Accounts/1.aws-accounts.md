#            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/accounts-welcome.html

AWS accounts are the **fundamental unit of isolation, billing, security, and service control** in the Amazon Web Services ecosystem. Whether you're a single developer or a global enterprise, understanding how AWS accounts work is **critical** for managing access, cost, security, and scalability.

---
## üîπ 1. What Is an AWS Account?

An **AWS account** is a container for:

* **Billing** and **usage tracking**
* **Identity and access management (IAM)**
* **Resource provisioning and isolation**
* **Security controls and logging**

Each account has:

* A unique **12-digit account ID**
* One **root user** (created with the account)
* Separate **IAM users/roles** for controlled access

---

## üîπ 2. Account Components

### üßë Root User

* Created when you first register.
* Has **full access** to everything.
* Should be used **only for account-level tasks** (e.g., billing, MFA setup, contact updates).
* **Must enable MFA** for root user for security.

---

### üë• IAM Users and Roles

* **IAM users**: Named individuals (e.g., developers, admins).
* **IAM roles**: Temporary access credentials for:

  * Services (e.g., EC2 assuming a role)
  * Cross-account access
  * Federated users (SSO)

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Account Alias

* Optional, user-friendly name for the AWS sign-in URL.
* Example: `https://mycompany.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`

---

## üîπ 3. Multi-Account Strategy

### Why Use Multiple AWS Accounts?

A common enterprise practice is to use **multiple AWS accounts** for:

| Purpose                     | Example                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Environment separation**  | Dev, Test, Staging, Production         |
| **Workload isolation**      | Analytics, IoT, Web, ML                |
| **Team/project separation** | Project A, B, or Department 1, 2       |
| **Security boundaries**     | Payment services vs internal apps      |
| **Compliance**              | HIPAA or GDPR-specific workloads       |
| **Billing separation**      | Track cost by team, project, or client |

---

### AWS Organizations

To manage multiple AWS accounts efficiently, use **[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/)**:

* Create **organizational units (OUs)** to group accounts
* Apply **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** for governance
* Share **billing** across accounts with consolidated billing
* Automate account creation with **Account Factory (Control Tower)**

---

## üîπ 4. Types of AWS Accounts (by usage)

| Type                      | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Individual**            | Single user account, often used for testing or learning    |
| **Business**              | Company-wide account, may host multiple workloads          |
| **Linked**                | Part of an AWS Organization, usage is billed centrally     |
| **Control Tower Account** | Managed via AWS Control Tower, includes pre-set guardrails |
| **Payer Account**         | The billing/master account in an AWS Organization          |
| **Member Account**        | Child accounts under a payer account                       |

---

## üîπ 5. Account-Level Settings

### ‚öôÔ∏è Account Settings:

* Default region preferences
* Contact details (email, phone)
* Alternate contacts for:

  * Billing
  * Operations
  * Security

### üîí Security Settings:

* Root MFA (mandatory for best practice)
* Password policies (min length, complexity, rotation)
* Access Analyzer to detect unintended resource access

### üìä Billing Preferences:

* Enable/disable consolidated billing
* Cost Explorer & Budgets
* Enable detailed billing reports
* Set up usage alerts

---

## üîπ 6. Cross-Account Access

You can **grant access from one AWS account to another** using:

* **IAM roles with trust policies**
* **Resource policies** (S3, KMS, etc.)
* **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** to share resources

---

## üîπ 7. AWS Account Limits (Quotas)

Every account has default **service limits**, e.g.:

* EC2 instances per region
* VPCs per region
* IAM roles per account

These are **soft limits** and can be increased by submitting a **quota increase request**.

---

## üîπ 8. Best Practices

‚úÖ Use **multiple accounts** for isolation and control
‚úÖ Enable **MFA on root account**
‚úÖ Use **IAM roles**, not long-term access keys
‚úÖ Use **AWS Organizations** and **Control Tower**
‚úÖ Monitor with **AWS Config**, **CloudTrail**, and **GuardDuty**
‚úÖ Set **billing alerts and budgets**
‚úÖ Use **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** for governance
‚úÖ Limit the use of **root account** to billing-only tasks
