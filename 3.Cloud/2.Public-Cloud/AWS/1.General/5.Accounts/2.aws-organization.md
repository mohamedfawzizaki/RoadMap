#                                       üè¢ AWS Organizations
#             https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html


The **AWS Organization** service is a **centralized account management tool** that enables you to manage and govern **multiple AWS accounts** as a single entity. It is essential for medium to large teams, regulated industries, or anyone implementing a **multi-account strategy** for better **security**, **billing**, and **resource control**.

---
## üîπ What Is AWS Organizations?

AWS Organizations allows you to:

‚úÖ **Create and manage multiple AWS accounts**
‚úÖ **Group accounts into Organizational Units (OUs)**
‚úÖ **Apply policies (SCPs)** to enforce governance rules
‚úÖ **Share resources** between accounts
‚úÖ **Consolidate billing** across all accounts

---

## üîê Why Use AWS Organizations?

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Security Isolation          | Prevent blast radius; isolate workloads            |
| Governance & Control        | Apply policies across accounts centrally           |
| Cost Management             | Consolidated billing, budgets, and cost allocation |
| Team & Department Structure | Map AWS accounts to teams or business units        |
| Scalability                 | Cleanly scale workloads with isolated environments |
| Resource Sharing            | Share services like VPCs, License Manager, etc.    |

## üß± Core Components

### 1. **Management (Payer) Account**

* The **root** account of the organization.
* Responsible for:

  * **Creating and managing member accounts**
  * **Paying bills for all accounts**
  * **Applying policies**
  * Managing **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**

---

### 2. **Member Accounts**

* Accounts **within** the organization.
* Can be:

  * Created from the Management Account (automated)
  * Invited to join from outside (manual)
* Governed by:

  * **Inherited SCPs**
  * **Billing configuration** (linked usage)

---

### 3. **Organizational Units (OUs)**

* Logical groupings of accounts (like folders).
* Used to:

  * Apply different **SCPs** to different business units.
  * Manage **environments** like dev, staging, prod.
  * Create **hierarchies** for delegation and structure.

> Example:

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev OU
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev-App-1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dev-App-2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod OU
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod-App-1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Prod-App-2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Security OU
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logging-Account
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GuardDuty-Account
```

---

### 4. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**

* **Govern permissions** across accounts.
* Unlike IAM, SCPs **limit the maximum available permissions** ‚Äî like a **permissions boundary**.
* Examples:

  * Deny use of specific regions
  * Prevent S3 bucket deletion
  * Require EC2 encryption

> SCPs do not grant access ‚Äî they restrict what IAM policies can allow.

---

### 5. **Consolidated Billing**

* One bill for all accounts in the org.
* Features:

  * View **combined or individual account usage**
  * Set up **budgets, cost allocation tags, and chargebacks**
  * Benefit from **volume pricing discounts**

---

### 6. **Account Creation and Automation**

* Create accounts programmatically via:

  * **AWS Organizations Console**
  * **Organizations API**
  * **Control Tower** (recommended for guardrails & landing zones)

---

### 7. **Resource Sharing**

* Use **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** to share:

  * VPC subnets
  * License Manager
  * Transit Gateways
  * Route 53 Hosted Zones
* Sharing is **secure and managed by Organization trust**

---

## üß∞ Example Use Case: Multi-Environment Setup

You have:

* Dev and test environments (less strict)
* Production (strict policies)
* Security team (central logging, guardrails)

Set up like this:

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Development OU (SCP: allow most services)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-ml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Production OU (SCP: deny non-approved regions)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod-ecommerce
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prod-analytics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Security OU (SCP: deny deletes)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging-account
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compliance-account
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

‚úÖ Enable **MFA on root users**
‚úÖ Use **SCPs to enforce compliance**
‚úÖ Set up a **Security OU** for:

* Central logging (CloudTrail, S3)
* GuardDuty, Security Hub, etc.

‚úÖ Use **AWS Config and CloudTrail** in all accounts
‚úÖ Store logs **cross-account** into security logging account
‚úÖ Define **naming conventions** for accounts and OUs

## üö® Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                           | Why It's Risky                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Using one account for everything  | Increases blast radius, billing complexity      |
| Not using SCPs                    | No centralized control or guardrails            |
| Allowing root user use            | High security risk                              |
| Not enabling consolidated billing | Lose volume discounts, tracking becomes harder  |
| Not using automation              | Manual account creation is slow and error-prone |

## üß† Summary

| Feature                    | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Organization           | Central hub to manage multiple accounts                    |
| Management Account         | Root of the org; handles billing & governance              |
| Organizational Units (OUs) | Groupings of accounts for structure and policy control     |
| SCPs                       | Set permission boundaries for what accounts can do         |
| Consolidated Billing       | One invoice for the org, with cost allocation              |
| Resource Sharing           | Secure inter-account sharing of resources                  |
| Ideal for                  | Enterprises, agencies, multi-team setups, governance needs |

**Organizational Units (OUs)** in **AWS Organizations** are **logical containers** used to **group AWS accounts** within your organization. They allow you to apply **governance policies (Service Control Policies - SCPs)** and manage access and compliance in a **hierarchical, scalable way**.

#                        # üóÇÔ∏è AWS Organizational Units (OUs) ‚Äì In Deep Detail

---

## üîπ What Is an OU?

An **Organizational Unit (OU)** is:

* A **folder-like structure** inside an AWS Organization
* Used to **group multiple AWS accounts**
* Can **nest other OUs** to form a hierarchy
* Inherits and enforces **SCPs** from its parent

---

## üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Structure

You can build a **tree-like structure** to mirror your org chart, environments, teams, or compliance boundaries.

Example:

```
[Root]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OU: Security
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Logging Account
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Audit Account
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OU: Production
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod-app1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prod-db
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OU: Development
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev-ml
```

> You can **nest OUs up to 5 levels deep**.

---

## üéØ Why Use OUs?

| Benefit                      | Description                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîê **Governance & Security** | Apply SCPs to enforce compliance at scale                  |
| üîÑ **Inheritance**           | Policies applied at parent OU apply to all nested children |
| üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Delegation**            | Different teams can manage their own OUs/accounts          |
| üí∞ **Billing & Reporting**   | Group costs by OU/project/environment                      |
| üîç **Auditing**              | Easier to target logs, alerts, and access controls         |
| üìà **Scalability**           | Add/remove accounts without reworking your architecture    |

---

## üîê Applying SCPs to OUs

SCPs (Service Control Policies) applied to an OU:

* Apply to **all accounts inside it**
* Can limit **which AWS services or actions** are allowed
* Are **merged** with policies from the parent/root OU

> Example: An SCP applied to the `Production OU` may:

* Deny use of non-approved regions
* Allow only encrypted S3 buckets
* Restrict IAM role creation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è OU Design Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Separate Workloads by Environment

Use OUs like:

* `Development`
* `Staging`
* `Production`

### ‚úÖ Centralize Security & Logging

Create a `Security OU` for accounts like:

* `Audit`
* `Log Archive`
* `Compliance`

### ‚úÖ Use OUs for Regulatory Segmentation

Group workloads needing:

* HIPAA/GDPR compliance
* US-only region access
* Stronger controls

### ‚úÖ Reflect Your Org‚Äôs Structure

Map OUs to:

* Business units (Finance, R\&D, IT)
* Application domains (Web, Mobile, Data)
* Teams or departments

## üß† OU vs. AWS Account

| Feature                 | Organizational Unit (OU)        | AWS Account                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Purpose                 | Grouping for policy enforcement | Logical isolation unit        |
| Contains                | Other OUs or AWS accounts       | AWS resources and users       |
| Policies Applied (SCPs) | Inherited down to accounts      | Evaluated against IAM + SCPs  |
| Access Scope            | No resources inside directly    | Full AWS services and billing |
| Deletable?              | Yes (only if empty)             | No (managed independently)    |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OU Limitations

* You **cannot attach IAM policies** to OUs ‚Äî only **SCPs**
* OUs do **not control billing directly** ‚Äî billing flows through accounts
* You **must delete all nested OUs and accounts** before deleting a parent OU
* Maximum **5 levels of OU nesting**

---

## üìå Summary

| Feature     | Details                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Group AWS accounts for governance              |
| Structure   | Tree hierarchy (up to 5 levels)                |
| Policies    | Apply SCPs to enforce access/control           |
| Inheritance | SCPs inherited from parent/root OU             |
| Use Cases   | Environments, security domains, business units |
| Works With  | AWS Organizations, Control Tower, SCPs, RAM    |
| Key Benefit | **Centralized governance at scale**            |
