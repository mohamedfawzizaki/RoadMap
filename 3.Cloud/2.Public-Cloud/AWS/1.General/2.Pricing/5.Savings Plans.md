#                                   AWS Savings Plans

## 🔍 What are AWS Savings Plans?

**Savings Plans** are a **usage-based discount model** that allows you to **commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (in \$/hr)** over **1 or 3 years** in exchange for **significant discounts** across services like:

* **Amazon EC2**
* **AWS Fargate**
* **AWS Lambda**

> ✅ You get RI-level discounts **without being locked into instance types, sizes, or regions** (depending on plan type).

---

## 💰 Key Concept

Instead of reserving a specific instance (like in RIs), you commit to **spending a certain \$/hour**, and AWS applies that commitment to **eligible usage** automatically.

> Example: You commit to **\$50/hour for 1 year**
> If your actual usage = \$70/hour, the first \$50 gets the discount; the extra \$20 is billed at On-Demand rate.

## 🧾 Types of Savings Plans

| Plan Type          | Description                                          | Flexibility | Discount Potential|
| ------------------ | -----------------------------------------------------| ----------- | ------------------|
|Compute Savings Plan| Applies to any compute (instance family, region, OS) |  Highest    |  Up to 66%        |
|EC2 Instance Savings Plan| Applies to specific instance family and region  |  Moderate   |  Up to 72%        |

## 🔄 Comparison: Compute vs EC2 Instance Savings Plans

| Feature              | Compute SP    | EC2 Instance SP       |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Instance flexibility | Any           | Fixed instance family |
| OS/platform          | Any           | Any                   |
| Region flexibility   | Any           | Locked to a region    |
| Discount             | Lower         | Higher                |
| Ideal for            | Dynamic usage | Stable workloads      |

## 📆 Commitment Terms

| Term            | Options                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Duration        | 1-year or 3-year                         |
| Payment Options | No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront |

> 💡 The more you pay upfront, and the longer the term, the more discount you receive.

## 🧮 Example: Compute Savings Plan (1 Year, No Upfront)

| Instance         | On-Demand Price       | Savings Plan Price | Discount |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| EC2 `m5.large`   | \$0.096/hr            | \~\$0.058/hr       | \~40%    |
| EC2 `c6g.medium` | \$0.034/hr            | \~\$0.020/hr       | \~41%    |
| Lambda           | Per-invocation/GB-sec | \~17–20% discount  | ✔️       |

---

## 💵 How Pricing is Applied

1. **Your commitment**: e.g., \$10/hour
2. AWS matches eligible usage up to \$10/hr with **discounted rates**
3. Any usage **above \$10/hr** is charged at **On-Demand** pricing

> Savings Plans are applied **automatically and prioritized** over On-Demand billing.

---

## 🧰 How to Purchase a Savings Plan

### Via AWS Console:

1. Go to **Billing > Savings Plans**
2. Choose plan type (Compute or EC2)
3. Choose:

   * Commitment amount (e.g., \$20/hr)
   * Duration (1 or 3 years)
   * Payment method (No Upfront, Partial, All Upfront)
4. Review and purchase

### Via AWS CLI:

```bash
aws savingsplans create-savings-plan \
  --savings-plan-offering-id sp-xyz \
  --commitment "10" \
  --savings-plan-type Compute \
  --term 31536000 \
  --payment-option NoUpfront
```

## ✅ Benefits of Savings Plans

| Benefit                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| High savings             | Up to 72% (same as RIs)                          |
| Simpler than RIs         | Just choose \$/hr, not instance types            |
| Flexible compute         | Resize, change family, switch regions            |
| Auto-applied             | Discount is used automatically                   |
| Ideal for serverless too | Works for **Fargate** and **Lambda**, unlike RIs |

## ❌ Limitations of Savings Plans

| Limitation                     | Description                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1- or 3-year lock-in           | No cancellations or reductions once committed |
| Prepaid or monthly bill        | You're billed **regardless of usage**         |
| EC2 Instance SP is restrictive | Similar to Standard RIs in limitation         |
| Not applicable to all services | Doesn’t cover S3, RDS, etc. (only compute)    |

## 📊 Monitoring and Tracking

Use these AWS tools to manage your Savings Plans:

| Tool                                 | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **AWS Cost Explorer**                | Visualize usage and savings      |
| **Savings Plans Utilization Report** | % of your hourly commitment used |
| **Budgets**                          | Alert if spend is > plan         |
| **Trusted Advisor**                  | Recommends SP purchases          |

## 🧮 Example: Monthly Cost Comparison

Let's assume:

* You run 5x `m5.large` EC2 instances
* Region: `us-east-1`
* Usage: 24x7 (730 hours/month)

| Model                | Hourly Rate          | Monthly Cost               |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| On-Demand            | \$0.096 × 5 = \$0.48 | \$350.40                   |
| Compute SP (40% off) | \$0.058 × 5 = \$0.29 | \~\$211.70                 |
| **Savings**          | —                    | **\$138.70/month (\~39%)** |

## 🧠 Best Practices

1. ✅ Use **Compute SP** unless you know your workload won’t change
2. 📊 Analyze current usage before committing (Cost Explorer > Recommendations)
3. 🧪 Test workloads under **On-Demand** first, then commit after analysis
4. 🏷️ Use **tags** to track which workloads are covered by SPs
5. ⚖️ Combine **On-Demand**, **Savings Plans**, and **Spot Instances** for optimal cost-efficiency
