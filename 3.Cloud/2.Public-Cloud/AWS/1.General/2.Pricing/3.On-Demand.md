#                                     On-Demand Pricing Model

## 🧾 What is **On-Demand Pricing**?

The **On-Demand model** is the most **flexible and straightforward** pricing option on AWS. You **pay per unit of usage** — per second, minute, or hour — **with no upfront commitment**.

> You only pay for the exact resources you use, for as long as you use them.

## 🧠 When to Use On-Demand

| Ideal When                          | Not Ideal When                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Development & testing environments  | Steady, long-term production workloads                 |
| Short-lived apps or spikes in usage | High-volume predictable traffic                        |
| Unpredictable workloads             | Cost-optimized workloads (consider RI or Savings Plan) |
| Trying out new services             | Long-term projects with consistent load                |

## 📦 Commonly Used Services with On-Demand Pricing

| Service        | How On-Demand is Billed                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **EC2**        | Per second (Linux) or per hour (Windows)  |
| **RDS**        | Per hour for DB instance + storage + IOPS |
| **EBS**        | Per GB-month of volume + IOPS             |
| **Lambda**     | Per invocation + GB-seconds used          |
| **S3**         | Per GB per month + per request            |
| **CloudWatch** | Per metric + logs ingested & retained     |

## ⏱️ EC2 On-Demand Pricing Details

### 🧮 Billing Method:

* **Linux EC2** instances: **Per second** with 60-second minimum
* **Windows/others**: **Per hour**

### 🧾 Example:

* EC2 `t3.medium` in `us-east-1`: `$0.0416 per hour`

  * Use for 3 hours = \$0.1248
  * Shut down = no cost (except attached EBS)

> You pay only for the **running time** of the instance.

---

## 🗃️ RDS On-Demand Pricing

### Charged for:

* DB instance hours
* Allocated storage (GB/month)
* Backup storage (after free quota)
* IOPS (if using Provisioned IOPS)

### 🧾 Example:

* RDS MySQL `db.t3.micro`: \~\$0.018/hour

---

## 📥 S3 On-Demand Pricing

* **Storage**: `$0.023/GB/month` (Standard tier)
* **Requests**:

  * GET: `$0.0004 per 1,000 requests`
  * PUT: `$0.005 per 1,000 requests`

You are billed monthly based on how much data you stored and how many API requests you made.

---

## ⚙️ Lambda On-Demand Pricing

### Charges based on:

* **Number of invocations**
* **Duration** (ms) × **memory** (MB)

| Metric                | Price                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1M requests           | \$0.20                     |
| 400,000 GB-seconds    | Free (monthly tier)        |
| Additional GB-seconds | \$0.00001667 per GB-second |

---

## 🔁 Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)

### On-Demand Pricing Includes:

* Hourly charge (e.g., \$0.025/hr)
* **LCU (Load Capacity Units)**: Based on new connections, active flows, and data processed

## 🌐 Data Transfer On-Demand

| Direction            | Cost             |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Inbound to AWS       | Free             |
| Outbound to internet | \~\$0.09/GB      |
| Between AZs          | \~\$0.01/GB      |
| Between regions      | \~\$0.02–0.09/GB |

## ✅ Advantages of On-Demand

| Benefit                   | Description                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Flexibility               | No contracts or commitments                      |
| Great for experimentation | Perfect for dev/test and POCs                    |
| Scales automatically      | Just launch what you need when you need it       |
| Per-second billing        | Pay only for what you actually use (EC2, Lambda) |

---

## ❌ Disadvantages of On-Demand

| Limitation                                 | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| More expensive long-term                   | Up to **3x more** than Reserved Instances       |
| Not cost-effective for steady workloads    | Use RIs or Savings Plans if predictable         |
| Volatile pricing risk                      | Can fluctuate slightly in some services/regions |

## 🧮 Sample Monthly Cost: EC2 On-Demand

| Instance         | Type      | Hours         | Cost     |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| EC2              | t3.medium | 730 (1 month) | \$30.37  |
| EBS              | 50 GB gp3 | N/A           | \~\$4.50 |
| Outbound Traffic | 50 GB     | N/A           | \~\$4.50 |

**Total: \~\$39.37/month**

## 🧰 Tips to Optimize On-Demand Use

1. 🛑 **Auto-stop dev/test EC2** when not in use (e.g., nights/weekends)
2. 📈 **Use Auto Scaling** to match usage dynamically
3. 📉 Monitor usage with **AWS Cost Explorer**
4. ⚖️ **Compare to Reserved or Savings Plans** after 3–6 months
5. 🎯 Tag resources with “env\:dev”, “env\:prod” for cost tracking
