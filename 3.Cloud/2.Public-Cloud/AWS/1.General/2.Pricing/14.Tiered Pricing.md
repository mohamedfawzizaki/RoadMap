#                                       Tiered Pricing model in AWS

## üîç What Is Tiered Pricing?

**Tiered Pricing** means that the **unit price decreases** as your **usage increases**.

> üß† You are billed **based on how much you use** within each pricing tier ‚Äî not a flat rate.

**For example:**

* First 10 TB @ \$0.09/GB
* Next 40 TB @ \$0.085/GB
* 100+ TB @ \$0.07/GB

If you use **60 TB**, you pay:

* 10 TB √ó \$0.09
* 40 TB √ó \$0.085
* 10 TB √ó \$0.07
  **NOT 60 TB √ó one rate**

## üìà How Tiered Pricing Works

| Tier   | Usage Range | Unit Price |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Tier 1 | 0‚Äì10 TB     | \$0.09/GB  |
| Tier 2 | 10‚Äì50 TB    | \$0.085/GB |
| Tier 3 | 50‚Äì150 TB   | \$0.07/GB  |
| Tier 4 | 150‚Äì500 TB  | \$0.05/GB  |

‚û°Ô∏è The **more you use**, the **cheaper the next GB becomes**
‚û°Ô∏è You pay **different rates** for different **portions** of usage

## üß© Services That Use Tiered Pricing

| AWS Service    | Resource           | Applies To                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |

## üßæ Example: S3 Standard Storage Tiered Pricing (US-East)

| Tier                | Usage   | Price (per GB) |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| First 50 TB / month | \$0.023 |                |
| Next 450 TB         | \$0.022 |                |
| Over 500 TB         | \$0.021 |                |

üßÆ If you store 600 TB:

* 50 TB √ó \$0.023 = \$1,150
* 450 TB √ó \$0.022 = \$9,900
* 100 TB √ó \$0.021 = \$2,100
  **Total: \$13,150/month**

| Next 40 TB  | \$0.085/GB |
| Next 100 TB | \$0.07/GB  |
| 150 TB+     | \$0.05/GB  |

This model applies to:

* EC2
* RDS

## üí° Why AWS Uses Tiered Pricing

| Goal                       | Description                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üìâ **Economies of scale**  | Reward users with lower costs as they scale usage                 |
| ‚öñÔ∏è **Cost optimization**   | Encourages large workloads to stay on AWS                         |
| üéØ **Predictable billing** | Gradual cost adjustments instead of step pricing                  |
| üåç **Competitive pricing** | Especially important for global content delivery (CDNs, S3, etc.) |

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Tiered Pricing

| Benefit                        | Why It Matters                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Cost-effective at scale      | You pay less per unit with high usage          |
| ‚úÖ No surprises                 | Transparent thresholds published               |
| ‚úÖ Encourages growth            | Suitable for large-volume apps and enterprises |
| ‚úÖ Often includes **free tier** | 1 GB outbound, 1M requests, etc.               |

## ‚ùå Potential Pitfalls

| Pitfall                             | Details                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| üí• Usage spikes may still be costly | Even if unit price drops, total bill rises          |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Misunderstanding tiers           | Assumption that entire usage gets the lowest rate   |
| üßÆ Complex calculations             | When combining data transfer + storage + operations |
| ‚ùå Not all services tiered the same | Some services (like Lambda) use flat pricing        |

## üìê Cost Optimization with Tiered Pricing

| Strategy                            | Effect                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aggregate usage across accounts** | Tiers are applied **across all accounts** under an Org 'Consolidated Billing'|
| **Use CloudFront for data egress**  | Cheaper than EC2/S3 direct transfer                              |
| **Delete old S3 objects**           | Reduces tier usage and lowers pricing level                      |
| **Use lifecycle policies**          | Migrate data from expensive tiers (S3 Standard) to cheaper ones  |
| **Enable Cost Explorer**            | View tiered thresholds and usage trends                          |

## üß† Tiered vs Volume vs Flat Pricing

| Model      | Definition                                | Example                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Tiered** | Each usage range has different price      | EC2 data transfer                     |
| **Volume** | All usage charged at lowest achieved rate | (Not commonly used in AWS)            |
| **Flat**   | One price per unit                        | Lambda requests, Step Functions, etc. |

## üö® Real Example Alert

If you're pushing **30 TB/month** out of EC2:

* You **don't** pay 30 TB √ó \$0.09 = \$2,700
* You pay:

  * 10 TB √ó \$0.09 = \$900
  * 20 TB √ó \$0.085 = \$1,700
    ‚úÖ **Total = \$2,600**

A small difference here‚Ä¶ but with **100s of TB**, you can save **thousands/month** using tiered pricing properly.
