#                                     AWS Pricing Models

AWS offers **multiple pricing models** across its services to give you **flexibility**, **cost-efficiency**, and **control**. These pricing models apply to services like EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, etc.

---

## 🧩 1. **On-Demand Pricing**

### 📌 Description:

Pay for compute, storage, and network **by the second, minute, or hour** — with **no long-term commitment**.

| Use When                                  |  Avoid When                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Workloads are short-term or unpredictable | You have steady-state or predictable workloads |

### 📊 Example:

* **EC2** `t3.medium` in `us-east-1`: `$0.0416/hour`
* **RDS** MySQL: `$0.018/hour`

---

## 🛍️ 2. **Reserved Instances (RIs)**

### 📌 Description:

Make a **1- or 3-year commitment** to a specific EC2 instance type and region, and get up to **72% discount**.

| Plan        | Discount  | Flexibility                     |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Standard    | Up to 72% | Fixed instance family           |
| Convertible | Up to 66% | Can change instance types or OS |

### ✅ Use When:

* Long-term workloads (e.g., web servers, databases)
* High availability production workloads

### ❌ Avoid When:

* Workloads are sporadic or short-lived

---

## 💡 3. **Savings Plans**

### 📌 Description:

A **flexible alternative** to RIs. Commit to a specific **dollar amount (\$/hr)** of usage, and apply discounts across compute services.

| Type                      | Applies To                                           | Flexibility      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Compute Savings Plan      | EC2, Lambda, Fargate (any instance type, region, OS) | Very flexible    |
| EC2 Instance Savings Plan | Specific instance family in a region                 | Less flexible    |

### ✅ Use When:

* You want **RI-level savings** with **more flexibility**

---

## 🌀 4. **Spot Instances**

### 📌 Description:

Buy unused AWS EC2 capacity at **up to 90% discount**, but AWS **can reclaim it anytime** with 2-minute notice.

### ✅ Use When:

* Workloads are **stateless, fault-tolerant, interruptible**
* Examples: batch jobs, big data, CI/CD, rendering

### ❌ Avoid When:

* You need high availability or persistent workloads

---

## 📆 5. **Dedicated Hosts**

### 📌 Description:

Pay for a **physical EC2 server** (host) dedicated to you. Helps with **license compliance**, **regulatory**, or **hardware isolation**.

### ✅ Use When:

* Bring-your-own-license (BYOL) for Windows/Oracle
* Need physical isolation

---

## 🧳 6. **Dedicated Instances**

### 📌 Description:

EC2 instances that run on **hardware not shared** with other AWS customers — unlike Dedicated Hosts, you don't control the entire host.

### ✅ Use When:

* You want **instance-level isolation**
* Don't need full host-level control

---

## 🧾 7. **Free Tier**

### 📌 Description:

A **promotional pricing model** to let you explore AWS services **for free**, under limited usage caps.

| Type          | Duration       | Examples                                   |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 12-month free | New accounts   | EC2, RDS, S3 (limited hours/storage)       |
| Always free   | Unlimited time | Lambda, CloudWatch, DynamoDB (small usage) |

---

## 🌐 8. **Data Transfer Pricing**

### 📌 Description:

Charged based on **volume and direction** of data. Applies across services.

| Direction                 | Price                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Inbound to AWS            | Free                        |
| Outbound to internet      | \~\$0.09/GB (first GB free) |
| Region to Region          | \~\$0.02–0.09/GB            |
| AZ to AZ (in same region) | \~\$0.01/GB                 |

---

## 📦 9. **Request-Based Pricing**

### 📌 Description:

You’re billed per **API call or request**, not compute/storage time. Common in:

* **Lambda**
* **API Gateway**
* **DynamoDB**
* **S3**

### ✅ Use When:

* Applications are **event-driven** or scale heavily with usage

---

## 🧠 10. **Provisioned Capacity Pricing**

### 📌 Description:

Pay for reserved throughput or capacity instead of per-use billing.

### Used In:

* DynamoDB (Provisioned mode)
* CloudFront Reserved Capacity
* Redshift Reserved Nodes

---

## ⚡ 11. **Serverless Pricing (Per-Invocation/Per-GB-second)**

### 📌 Description:

Billed based on **requests + compute time** + **memory used**

### Example:

* **Lambda**:

  * \$0.20 per 1M requests
  * \$0.00001667 per GB-second

### ✅ Use When:

* Need high scalability without server provisioning
* Events vary day-to-day (e.g., APIs, cron jobs)

---

## 🧮 12. **Tiered Pricing**

### 📌 Description:

Unit cost **decreases** as usage increases. Applies to:

| Service       | Pricing Tier                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| S3 Storage    | \$0.023 → \$0.021 → \$0.019 per GB as volume increases |
| CloudFront    | Reduced rates for higher traffic                       |
| Data Transfer | Discounts for >10 TB/month                             |

---

## 🧘 13. **Committed Use Discounts (Enterprise Support)**

### 📌 Description:

In **Enterprise Agreements**, you can negotiate **committed spending** for additional discounts.

| Use Case          | When to Use                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Large enterprises | Committed multi-year cloud spend |
