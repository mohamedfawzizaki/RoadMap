#                                         AWS Dedicated Instances

## üîç What Are Dedicated Instances?

**Dedicated Instances** are **EC2 instances** that run on **hardware dedicated to a single AWS account**, but **do not give you control over the underlying physical host**.

> üß† Think of it like:
> ‚úÖ You get **hardware isolation**
> ‚ùå But **no visibility** or **control** over sockets, cores, or placement

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How They Work

When you launch a **Dedicated Instance**, AWS ensures that:

* Your EC2 instance **does not share physical hardware** (host) with other customers
* It **might share** the hardware with **other instances in your own account**
* It behaves like a regular EC2 instance otherwise (no special API/CLI needed)

## üßæ Key Characteristics

| Feature                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hardware Isolation**         | Only your account‚Äôs instances run on the host                |
| **No host control**            | Unlike Dedicated Hosts, you **can‚Äôt see or manage** the host |
| **Per-instance billing**       | Billed like regular EC2 ‚Äî per instance, per hour             |
| **Supports most EC2 features** | Like Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, etc.              |
| **No BYOL license tracking**   | Can‚Äôt use Microsoft BYOL that requires socket/core tracking  |

## üß† When to Use Dedicated Instances

| Use Case                        | Why It Fits                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Tenant isolation**          | To isolate workloads from other AWS accounts                 |
| üîê **Regulated workloads**      | Compliance with data residency, finance, or healthcare rules |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Lift-and-shift** workloads | Move legacy apps that require dedicated hardware             |
| üîÅ **Flexible autoscaling**     | Unlike Dedicated Hosts, supports dynamic scaling             |

## ‚ùå When Not to Use Dedicated Instances

| Reason                                | Why Not                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß† **License BYOL (Windows, Oracle)** | You need Dedicated Hosts for that                             |
| üîç **Need physical visibility**       | No host-level detail or placement                             |
| üí∏ **Cost-sensitive workloads**       | More expensive than shared instances                          |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Need capacity reservation**      | Use Dedicated Hosts or On-Demand Capacity Reservation instead |

## üì¶ Dedicated Instances vs Other EC2 Models

| Feature             | Shared EC2        | **Dedicated Instance**        | Dedicated Host         |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Hardware Isolation  | ‚ùå No             | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes                 |
| Host Control        | ‚ùå No             | ‚ùå No                        | ‚úÖ Yes                 |
| Billing             | Per instance      | Per instance                  | Per host                |

| Use Case            | General workloads | Compliance & tenant isolation | Compliance + licensing   |

## üí∞ Pricing Model

Dedicated Instances are charged as follows:

### 1. **Per-instance price**

* Based on instance type (e.g., `m5.large`, `r5.xlarge`)
* Same way as On-Demand, Reserved, or Savings Plans (if applied)

### 2. **Dedicated Tenancy Fee** *(Only for first instance per region)*

* **\$2 per region per hour** regardless of instance count
* This fee applies **only once per hour per region**

> üí° If you have multiple Dedicated Instances in the same region, you only pay the \$2/hour fee once.

---

## üßÆ Example Cost Breakdown (us-east-1)

You launch 3 `t3.medium` Dedicated Instances in `us-east-1`.

| Component        | Rate            | Total           |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Instance         | \$0.0416/hr √ó 3 | \$0.1248/hr     |
| Tenancy Fee      | \$2/hr          | \$2/hr          |
| **Total Hourly** |                 | **\$2.1248/hr** |

---

## üß∞ How to Launch Dedicated Instances

### üñ•Ô∏è Via AWS Console

1. Go to **EC2 > Launch Instance**
2. Under **Advanced Details > Tenancy**, choose `Dedicated`

### üíª Via AWS CLI

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type t3.medium \
  --placement "Tenancy=dedicated" \
  --subnet-id subnet-0123abc
```

### üõ†Ô∏è For Auto Scaling Groups

Use a **Launch Template** or **Launch Configuration** with tenancy set to `dedicated`.

---

## üì¶ Dedicated Tenancy in VPC

You can create a **Dedicated VPC** to ensure **all instances launched inside** it use Dedicated Instances automatically.

```bash
aws ec2 create-vpc \
  --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --instance-tenancy dedicated
```

> üß† Then all subnets and EC2 launched in this VPC will **default to dedicated tenancy**.

---

## üîç Monitoring & Auditing

Use:

* **AWS Config** to track tenancy compliance
* **CloudWatch** for resource-level metrics
* **Resource Groups** or **tagging** to separate dedicated from shared
