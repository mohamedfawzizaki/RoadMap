#                                    Reserved Instances (RIs) pricing model

## 🔍 What Are Reserved Instances?

**Reserved Instances (RIs)** are a pricing model that allows you to **reserve EC2 capacity** for a **1-year or 3-year term** in exchange for a **significant discount** (up to **72%**) over On-Demand prices.

> ❗ You don’t reserve actual **physical** instances, but instead a **billing discount** applied to matching running instances.

## 🧠 When to Use RIs

| Ideal For                           | Avoid For                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Predictable, steady-state workloads | Short-term or unpredictable workloads |
| Long-running web apps or databases  | Bursty, highly elastic apps           |
| Production environments             | Dev/test environments                 |

---

## 🧾 Types of Reserved Instances

AWS offers **two major RI types**, each with different levels of flexibility:

| Type                | Flexibility                        | Discount    | Convertible? |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Standard RIs**    | Fixed instance family, OS, AZ      | ✅ Up to 72% | ❌ No      |
| **Convertible RIs** | Can change instance type/family/OS | ✅ Up to 66% | ✅ Yes     |

---

## 💰 RI Payment Options

You can choose from **3 payment plans**:

| Payment Option             | Description                    | Discount Level                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **All Upfront (AURI)**     | Pay 100% upfront               | Highest discount                                 |
| **Partial Upfront (PURI)** | Pay part upfront, rest monthly | Moderate discount                                |
| **No Upfront (NURI)**      | Pay monthly over term          | Lowest discount (still better than On-Demand)    |

---

## 🔄 Convertible RIs in Detail

* You **can exchange** existing Convertible RIs for others with:

  * Different instance families (e.g., `m5 → r6`)
  * Different OS (Linux → Windows)
  * Different tenancy or platform
* You must exchange for **equal or greater total value**

Useful when:

* Your architecture evolves
* Instance needs change over time

---

## 🧭 How RIs Are Applied (Behind the Scenes)

* **RIs apply automatically** to **matching running On-Demand instances**
* Applies to:

  * Same Region
  * Same instance type, size, OS, tenancy, platform
* AWS optimizes which RIs are applied to minimize your cost

## 🧱 RI Scope: Regional vs Zonal

| Scope           | Description                              | Use Case                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Zonal RI**    | Tied to a specific **Availability Zone** | Provides **capacity reservation**        |
| **Regional RI** | Tied to a **Region**, not a specific AZ  | More **flexible**, no capacity guarantee |

> ✅ Regional RIs apply to any matching instance in the Region
> ✅ Zonal RIs reserve capacity (useful for regulated workloads)

---

## 🧮 Example: Cost Comparison

Let’s compare EC2 `m5.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GiB RAM) in `us-east-1`:

| Model                           | Hourly Rate | Monthly (\~730 hrs) | Annual  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| **On-Demand**                   | \$0.096     | \~\$70.08           | \~\$841 |
| **Standard RI (1 yr, AURI)**    | \~\$0.059   | \~\$43.07           | \~\$516 |
| **Convertible RI (1 yr, NURI)** | \~\$0.068   | \~\$49.64           | \~\$596 |

**💡 Savings: Up to 72% compared to On-Demand**

## ✅ RI Benefits

| Benefit                                 | Detail                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 💸 **Major cost savings**               | Up to 72% cheaper than On-Demand           |
| 📆 **Predictable billing**              | Great for budgeting and cost planning      |
| 🔄 **Convertible option**               | Flexibility to adapt to future changes     |
| 📦 **Applies automatically**            | You don’t need to manually match instances |
| ✅ **Capacity reservation (Zonal only)** | Guaranteed availability in critical AZs   |

## ❌ RI Limitations

| Limitation                             | Detail                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Less flexible                          | You’re locked in for 1–3 years                          |
| No automatic resizing                  | If you change instance size/type, you lose the benefit  |
| Standard RIs are not changeable        | You can’t modify or cancel them after purchase          |
| No capacity reservation (Regional RIs) | Only Zonal RIs guarantee capacity                       |

## 🧠 Best Practices

1. 📊 **Analyze usage with Cost Explorer** before buying
2. 🧪 Use RIs for **production**; keep **On-Demand** for dev/test
3. 🔁 **Use Convertible RIs** if workload flexibility is needed
4. 📍 Choose **Zonal RIs** for capacity guarantees (e.g., DR sites)
5. 🏷️ Use **resource tags** to track usage and match RIs properly
6. 🧮 Mix RIs with **Auto Scaling groups** using instance weighting

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Your RIs

Use AWS tools:

* **Cost Explorer** → Track RI utilization and coverage
* **RI Utilization Report** → % of RI usage
* **RI Coverage Report** → % of EC2 usage covered by RIs
