#                                           🏢 AWS Dedicated Hosts

## 🔍 What is a Dedicated Host?

An **AWS Dedicated Host** is a **physical EC2 server** that is **fully dedicated to your use**.

> Unlike standard EC2 instances (which may share hardware with other tenants), a Dedicated Host gives you **visibility and control over the physical server**.

---

## 🧾 Key Features of Dedicated Hosts

| Feature                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical server**       | You get full tenancy of the host — no sharing     |
| **Instance visibility**   | You see and manage the instance placement         |
| **License compliance**    | Supports BYOL (Windows, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) |
| **High compliance**       | Meets strict regulatory or audit requirements     |
| **Hardware isolation**    | Only your instances run on that hardware          |
| **Supports reservations** | Use On-Demand or reserve for 1–3 years            |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* You allocate a **Dedicated Host** (e.g., `c5`, `m5`, `r5`)
* The host supports **specific instance types and families**
* You then launch EC2 instances **onto that specific host**
* You control:

  * Instance placement
  * Licensing usage
  * Host lifecycle

## 📦 Use Cases

| Use Case                            | Why It Fits                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** | Reuse Windows Server, SQL, Oracle, or RHEL licenses        |
|   **Compliance**                    | Meet physical isolation, audit, or regulatory requirements |
|   **Visibility into sockets/cores** | Needed for enterprise licensing audits                     |
|   **Long-term workloads**           | Lower cost when reserved for 1–3 years                     |

---

## 📊 Pricing Model

Dedicated Hosts can be purchased in two ways:

| Option             | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
|    **On-Demand**   | Pay per hour with no commitment                   |
|    **Reservation** | 1- or 3-year term with large discounts (like RIs) |

You’re billed **per host**, not per instance. The host supports multiple EC2 instances, and you manage the allocations.

---

## 🧮 Example: Cost Breakdown

| Host Type           | Supported Instances         | On-Demand Price |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| `m5 Dedicated Host` | `m5.large` to `m5.24xlarge` | \~\$2.29/hr     |
| `c5 Dedicated Host` | `c5.large` to `c5.24xlarge` | \~\$2.17/hr     |

> Instead of paying per instance, you pay **per host** and pack as many EC2 instances as the host supports.

---

## 📐 Sockets, Cores, vCPUs

Dedicated Hosts expose full **hardware topology**:

* Number of **sockets**
* Number of **cores per socket**
* **Total vCPUs**

This helps meet licensing terms like:

* Microsoft’s **per-socket** licensing
* Oracle’s **core factor** licensing
* Windows Server **Datacenter Edition** licenses

---

## 🧠 Example Scenarios

### 📌 Windows BYOL

You have:

* A Windows Server **Datacenter License** covering 2 sockets
* You need **physical server visibility**

Use Dedicated Hosts to:

* Deploy unlimited Windows VMs on that host
* Track licensing per socket/core
* Stay compliant with Microsoft audits

## 🛡️ Security and Isolation

| Security Feature                  | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧍‍♂️ **Single-tenant host**          | Fully isolated at the **hardware level**                                               |
| 🔐 **Dedicated networking**       | Not shared with other customers                                                        |
| 🔍 **Instance placement control** | Full visibility into where your instances run                                          |
| 🔄 **Affinity**                   | Use **Host Affinity** to ensure the same instance stays on the same host after restart |

---

## 🏗️ Deployment Options

### Via AWS Console:

1. Go to **EC2 > Dedicated Hosts**
2. Choose instance family (e.g., `m5`, `r5`)
3. Select Availability Zone
4. Allocate the host
5. Launch EC2 instance and target the Dedicated Host

### Via AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ec2 allocate-hosts \
  --instance-type m5.large \
  --availability-zone us-east-1a \
  --quantity 1 \
  --auto-placement on
```

---

## 🔁 Auto Placement

You can control whether instances are:

* **Auto-placed** onto available Dedicated Hosts
* **Manually placed** by specifying the host ID

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abc12345 \
  --instance-type m5.large \
  --placement "HostId=host-0abc123def456"
```
