#                                      Enterprise Discounts Model

## 🔍 What Is the Enterprise Discount Model?

The **Enterprise Discount Program (EDP)** is a **custom, contract-based discount model** where AWS provides **significant price reductions** to organizations that commit to a **minimum annual AWS spend** over **1 to 5 years**.

> 🧠 EDP is **not automatic**. It’s negotiated between the customer and AWS, typically through an AWS Account Manager or AWS Partner.

## 📑 Key Characteristics

| Feature                        | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enterprise contract**        | You commit to spend a specific amount annually for 1–5 years        |
| **Volume-based discounts**     | The more you commit to spend, the deeper the discount               |
| **Customized pricing**         | Tailored to your usage profile (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda, etc.)        |
| **Blended with other models**  | Can be used alongside Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, Spot, etc. |
| **Includes value-adds**        | Credits, support upgrades, training, and partnership incentives     |

## 🧮 How the EDP Works

1. **Assessment Phase**
   AWS analyzes your current usage and forecasts your future needs.

2. **Contract Negotiation**
   You agree to spend, e.g., **\$2M per year for 3 years** across your AWS accounts.

3. **Discount Agreement**
   AWS provides **% discounts** on services (up to 20–40% or more), often bundled with:

   * **Enterprise Support**
   * **Training vouchers**
   * **Migration credits**
   * **Custom pricing**

4. **Billing Starts**
   You receive a **blended bill** where some services are deeply discounted, while others retain standard pricing.
