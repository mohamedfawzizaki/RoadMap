Thanks for clarifying! A **typical DevOps interview process** consists of **multiple stages**, depending on the company. Here's a structured breakdown for most companies hiring **Mid to Senior DevOps / Cloud Engineers**:

---

## ✅ **Typical DevOps Interview Stages**

### **1. CV Screening**

* Recruiter/HR reviews your resume for:

  * Cloud experience (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  * CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab)
  * Kubernetes, Docker
  * Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
  * Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
  * Scripting skills (Bash, Python, etc.)

---

### **2. HR / Recruiter Screening Call (15–30 min)**

* Discuss your career goals and current role
* Confirm your DevOps experience
* Explain your most recent projects
* Discuss salary expectations & availability
* Sometimes very basic technical questions (e.g., "What is CI/CD?")

---

### **3. Technical Screening (30–60 min)**

Usually remote (Google Meet / Zoom), led by a DevOps Lead/Engineer.

➡️ **Topics Covered:**

* Kubernetes basics (pods, deployments, services)
* Docker fundamentals
* CI/CD pipelines (describe one you built)
* Terraform/Ansible use cases
* Troubleshooting examples (e.g., failing pods, broken pipelines)
* Cloud basics (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC)

➡️ **Example Questions:**

* How do you deploy a containerized app to Kubernetes?
* Explain Terraform state management.
* What is the difference between Jenkins pipeline stages and steps?
* How would you debug a failing microservice in production?

---

### **4. Technical Assignment / Hands-On Test (Optional)**

➡️ Examples:

* Write a Dockerfile + Kubernetes manifest
* Build a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML file)
* Write Terraform to provision an EC2 instance
* Fix a broken deployment in a pre-configured environment

*Duration:* 1–3 hours, sometimes take-home.

---

### **5. Panel Technical Interview / Deep Dive (60–90 min)**

Often includes **2–3 senior engineers / DevOps leads.**

➡️ Deeper topics:

* Kubernetes production setups (monitoring, scaling, RBAC)
* High availability and disaster recovery
* Security (IAM, Secrets, network security)
* Infrastructure architecture design
* Cost optimization in the cloud
* Troubleshooting scenarios

---

### **6. System Design (Optional for Senior Roles)**

You might be asked to **design a full DevOps pipeline, infrastructure setup, or deployment flow.**

➡️ Example prompt:
*"Design a scalable CI/CD pipeline for a microservices-based application deployed on Kubernetes in AWS."*

---

### **7. Final HR / Hiring Manager Interview**

* Culture fit
* Team collaboration
* Career growth
* Remote work habits (if applicable)
