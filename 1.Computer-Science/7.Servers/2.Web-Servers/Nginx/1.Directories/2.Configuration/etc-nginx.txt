                                                      /etc/nginx/

The `/etc/nginx/` directory is the main configuration directory for Nginx on Linux systems. 
It contains several important files and subdirectories that control how Nginx functions. 

Below is a detailed breakdown:

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 1. `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
- The main Nginx configuration file.
- Defines global settings, worker processes, logging, and default server settings.
- Common sections:
  - `events {}`: Controls worker connections.
  - `http {}`: Configures web server behavior.
  - `server {}`: Defines virtual hosts and routing.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 2. `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`
- This directory contains additional configuration files.
- Typically used for including extra settings.
- Files inside are automatically included in `nginx.conf` using:
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 3. `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`
- Stores site-specific configuration files.
- Not automatically loaded; you need to enable sites manually.
- Example virtual host file (`example.com`):
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name example.com;
      root /var/www/example;
      index index.html index.php;
  }
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- To enable a site, create a symbolic link to `sites-enabled`:
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 4. `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
- Contains symbolic links to enabled sites.
- Only sites with links here will be served by Nginx.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 5. `/etc/nginx/snippets/`
- Stores reusable configuration snippets.
- Used for including common settings across multiple sites.
- Example: `ssl-params.conf` for SSL settings.
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
  ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
  ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Included in a server block using:
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
  include snippets/ssl-params.conf;
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 6. `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled/`
- Contains enabled dynamic modules.
- Loaded in `nginx.conf` using `load_module` directive.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 7. `/etc/nginx/mime.types`
- Defines supported MIME types for content delivery.
- Example:
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
  types {
      text/html html;
      image/png png;
  }
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 8. `/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params`
- Defines FastCGI parameters for PHP applications.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 9. `/etc/nginx/proxy_params`
- Contains settings for reverse proxy configurations.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 10. `/etc/nginx/uwsgi_params`
- Used for `uWSGI` applications.
