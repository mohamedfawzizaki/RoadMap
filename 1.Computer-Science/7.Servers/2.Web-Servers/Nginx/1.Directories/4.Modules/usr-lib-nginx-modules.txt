                                        üîπ Understanding `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/` Directory  

 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/`?  
The `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/` directory stores dynamically loadable Nginx modules. 
These modules extend Nginx‚Äôs functionality without recompiling the server.

üìå Location:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
cd /usr/lib/nginx/modules/
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

üìå Listing Available Modules:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
ls -la /usr/lib/nginx/modules/
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Nginx Modules
There are two types of Nginx modules:  

| Module Type     | Description 
| Static Modules  | Built into Nginx at compile time (e.g., core HTTP, proxy, FastCGI). 
| Dynamic Modules | Can be loaded or unloaded at runtime (`.so` files in `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/`). 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Nginx Dynamic Modules
To use a module from `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/`, add `load_module` in
 the Nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or inside a virtual host file).  

üìå Example: Load the Brotli compression module  
Edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and add:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so;
load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so;
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Then restart Nginx:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Modules in `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/`
| Module Name                               | Description 
| `ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so`        | Brotli compression for HTTP responses. 
| `ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so`        | Serves pre-compressed Brotli files. 
| `ngx_http_geoip_module.so`                | Allows GeoIP-based location tracking. 
| `ngx_http_image_filter_module.so`         | Enables image resizing and processing. 
| `ngx_http_headers_more_filter_module.so`  | Allows modifying HTTP headers. 
| `ngx_http_ssl_module.so`                  | Enables SSL/TLS support. 
| `ngx_http_vhost_traffic_status_module.so` | Provides real-time traffic stats.

 5Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Extra Modules
To install additional Nginx modules, use:  

üìå For Debian/Ubuntu:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
sudo apt install nginx-extras
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
üìå For RHEL/CentOS:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
sudo yum install nginx-mod-http-geoip
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
üìå For Arch Linux:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
sudo pacman -S nginx-mod-brotli
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 6Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Loaded Modules
To check which modules are currently loaded, run:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
nginx -V 2>&1 | grep "modules"
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Or check dynamically loaded modules:  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
grep "load_module" /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 7Ô∏è‚É£ Summary
- `/usr/lib/nginx/modules/` contains dynamically loadable Nginx modules (`.so` files).  
- Use `load_module` in `nginx.conf` to enable a module.  
- Check available modules using `ls -la /usr/lib/nginx/modules/`.  
- Install extra modules using `apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`.  
- Restart Nginx after enabling modules.
