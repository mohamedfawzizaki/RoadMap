                                                        Servers 
                                                        =======

A server is a computer or system that provides
 resources, data, services, or programs to other computers (clients) over a network.
 
Servers are the backbone of the internet, hosting websites, applications, databases, and files.
They operate in a client-server architecture where they respond to requests from client devices.

                                               How Servers Work

1.Client Request:
       - Clients (e.g., web browsers) send requests to a server via a network.

2.Processing:
       - The server receives the request, processes it using server software, and prepares a response.

3.Response:
       - The server sends the requested data (e.g., web pages, files, or results) back to the client.

                                             Server Deployment Models

1.Dedicated Servers:
       - Single server dedicated to a specific task or application.
       - High performance but expensive.

2.Shared Servers:
       - Multiple clients share server resources.
       - Cost-effective but less customizable.

3.Virtual Servers:
       - Virtual machines hosted on physical servers.
       - Provide isolation and flexibility.

4.Cloud Servers:
       - Hosted on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
       - Scalable and highly available.

5.Edge Servers:
       - Deployed closer to users for low-latency applications.
       - Used in content delivery networks (CDNs).
