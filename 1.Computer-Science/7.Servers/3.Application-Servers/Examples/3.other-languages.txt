Absolutely! Let's look at **application servers across other popular languages** — including Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, and .NET — and what they use to serve web applications.

---

## 🌐 **Application Servers by Language**

---

### 🐍 **Python**

| Server         | Type                     | Notes |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **Gunicorn**   | WSGI HTTP server         | Most popular with Django, Flask |
| **uWSGI**      | WSGI server + features   | Production-grade, used with Nginx |
| **Daphne**     | ASGI server              | Async support (Django Channels) |
| **Hypercorn**  | ASGI server              | Async alternative to Gunicorn |
| **Waitress**   | Pure Python WSGI         | Easy to use, production-safe |

👉 **Frameworks** like **FastAPI**, **Django**, **Flask**, and **Starlette** use these servers under the hood.

---

### ⚙️ **Node.js**

Node doesn’t need a traditional app server — the server **is part of the app** via the `http` module or frameworks.

| Server/Framework | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| **Express.js**   | Lightweight web framework |
| **Fastify**      | High-performance alternative |
| **NestJS**       | Full-featured, Angular-style |
| **Koa**          | Created by Express team, minimal |
| **Hapi**         | Enterprise-grade |

👉 You **write your server** in JS/TS. No separate app server needed.

---

### 💎 **Ruby**

| Server        | Type | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------|
| **Puma**      | Multi-threaded app server | Default in Rails |
| **Unicorn**   | Multi-process (prefork)   | Older, stable |
| **Passenger** | Smart app server (Nginx + Ruby) | Easy deployment |
| **WEBrick**   | Dev-only (slow)           | Built into Ruby |

👉 Ruby on Rails uses **Puma** by default in modern versions.

---

### ⚡ **Go (Golang)**

Go apps usually **embed the web server directly** in the binary.

| Web Framework | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| **net/http**  | Standard library HTTP server |
| **Gin**       | Fast, minimalistic framework |
| **Fiber**     | Inspired by Express.js |
| **Echo**      | High performance and feature-rich |
| **Chi**       | Lightweight router |

👉 No need for an external app server — Go compiles to a **self-contained binary** that includes the server.

---

### 🧬 **.NET / C#**

| Server          | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Kestrel**     | Lightweight, cross-platform HTTP server; default in ASP.NET Core |
| **IIS**         | Windows web server; supports ASP.NET |
| **Nginx / Apache** | Used as reverse proxies in Linux deployments |

👉 **Kestrel** is used directly in .NET Core apps; can be fronted by **Nginx or IIS**.

---

### 🔥 **Elixir / Erlang**

| Server | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Cowboy** | HTTP server used in Phoenix framework |
| **Plug**   | Connection middleware for Elixir |
| **Phoenix** | Full-featured web framework using Cowboy under the hood |

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Language   | Typical App Server(s)                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| PHP        | RoadRunner, Swoole, PHP-FPM               |
| Java       | Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, WildFly, Payara  |
| Python     | Gunicorn, uWSGI, Daphne, Hypercorn        |
| Node.js    | None — built-in (Express, Fastify, etc.)  |
| Ruby       | Puma, Unicorn, Passenger                  |
| Go         | None — compiled server in binary          |
| .NET       | Kestrel, IIS                              |
| Elixir     | Cowboy (via Phoenix)                      |
