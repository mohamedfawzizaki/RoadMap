Here‚Äôs a **comprehensive list of PHP application servers**, including traditional and high-performance modern ones:

---

## üî• **Modern PHP Application Servers** (Persistent/High Performance)

These servers keep your PHP app **in memory**, reducing the boot time per request.

### 1. **RoadRunner**
- **Written in**: Go
- **Use Case**: Laravel (with Octane), Symfony, custom apps
- **Features**:
  - Multithreaded performance
  - Static file serving
  - GRPC, Queues, Events, and more
- **Website**: [https://roadrunner.dev](https://roadrunner.dev)

### 2. **Swoole**
- **Written in**: C (PHP Extension)
- **Use Case**: Laravel (with Octane), native Swoole apps
- **Features**:
  - Coroutine support
  - Async HTTP server
  - WebSockets, TCP, UDP support
- **Website**: [https://www.swoole.co.uk](https://www.swoole.co.uk)

### 3. **FrankenPHP**
- **Written in**: Go (by the Caddy web server team)
- **Use Case**: Symfony, WordPress, Laravel
- **Features**:
  - Built-in web server (no Nginx needed)
  - HTTP/3, TLS, QUIC, workers
- **Website**: [https://frankenphp.dev](https://frankenphp.dev)

## üßä **Traditional PHP Application Servers** (Stateless)

These servers start a new PHP process or re-parse the app on every request.

### 4. **PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)**
- **Most Common Setup**
- Works with: **Apache**, **Nginx**
- Easy to set up but **slow for large apps** (boot on every request)

### 5. **Apache mod_php**
- Loads PHP as a module inside Apache
- Simple but less efficient than PHP-FPM
- **Not recommended for production anymore**

### 6. **HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine)** ‚Äì _[Deprecated for PHP]_
- Created by Facebook
- Used to be a high-speed PHP runtime
- Now supports **Hack language**, not PHP
- **Not suitable for new PHP apps**

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Local Development Servers**

| Server | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Built-in PHP Server** (`php -S`) | Great for local testing |
| **Laravel's Artisan Serve** (`php artisan serve`) | Wrapper around PHP's built-in server |
| **Symfony CLI Server** | Symfony-specific |

## üí° TL;DR ‚Äî Which One Should You Use?

| Use Case | Recommended Server |
|----------|--------------------|
| **High performance Laravel** | RoadRunner or Swoole (with Octane) |
| **Symfony with native speed** | FrankenPHP or RoadRunner |
| **Simple shared hosting** | PHP-FPM with Apache or Nginx |
| **Microservices or APIs** | RoadRunner or Swoole |
| **Development** | Artisan serve or `php -S` |
