Great question — the distinction between **web servers** and **application servers** is subtle but important, especially when designing and deploying web applications.

Let’s break it down clearly and with practical examples:

---

## 🕸️ Web Servers vs ⚙️ Application Servers

| Feature | **Web Server** | **Application Server** |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Handles **HTTP requests** for static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) | Executes **business logic** and generates dynamic content |
| **Examples** | Nginx, Apache HTTP Server, Caddy, Lighttpd | Tomcat, WildFly, RoadRunner, Gunicorn, uWSGI, PHP-FPM |
| **Content Served** | Static content | Dynamic content (via backend code) |
| **Language Support** | Language-agnostic | Language-specific (Java, PHP, Python, etc.) |
| **Can run backend code?** | ❌ No (delegates to app server) | ✅ Yes |
| **Protocols** | HTTP, HTTPS | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, RMI, JMS (depends) |
| **Reverse Proxy Capable** | ✅ Yes | Usually not (except in some cases like RoadRunner) |

---

### ✅ **Web Server – What it Does**

A **web server** is designed to:
- Accept HTTP requests from browsers
- Serve static files quickly
- Proxy dynamic requests to the backend (application server)
- Handle SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
- Load balance and cache responses

#### 🔧 Common Web Servers:
| Web Server | Key Features |
|------------|--------------|
| **Nginx**  | Fast, lightweight, event-driven, reverse proxy |
| **Apache** | Modular, widely used, `.htaccess` support |
| **Caddy**  | HTTPS by default, easy config |
| **Lighttpd** | Lightweight, low memory usage |

---

### ⚙️ **Application Server – What it Does**

An **application server** runs your **backend code** (e.g., Laravel, Spring, Django, Node.js). It:
- Handles business logic
- Communicates with databases
- Processes user input
- Generates dynamic HTML, JSON, XML, etc.

#### 🎯 Examples by Language:

| Language | App Server Examples |
|----------|---------------------|
| **PHP**  | PHP-FPM, Swoole, RoadRunner |
| **Python** | Gunicorn, uWSGI, Daphne |
| **Java** | Tomcat, WildFly, Jetty |
| **.NET** | Kestrel |
| **Node.js** | Built-in (http module), Express apps |
| **Ruby** | Puma, Unicorn |
| **Elixir** | Cowboy |

---

### 📦 Combined Servers (Web + App)

Some tools **act as both** a web server and application server:

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Tomcat** | Can serve static + dynamic content |
| **FrankenPHP** | PHP app server with built-in HTTPS |
| **Node.js** | Web server is part of the app |
| **Go** (net/http) | Full server in a single binary |

## 🛠 Example Architecture

### 🔁 Typical Setup with Nginx

```text
Browser
   |
   V
[Nginx Web Server]
   |
   |-- Static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   |
   V
[Application Server]
   |
   V
[Database]
```

- Nginx handles SSL, serves static files
- Passes dynamic requests to PHP-FPM, Gunicorn, or Kestrel
- Application server processes the logic and returns a response

---

## 🔄 Summary

| Think of it like... |
|---------------------|
| **Web Server** is the **receptionist** — directs requests, serves basic info |
| **Application Server** is the **business logic brain** — actually does the work |
