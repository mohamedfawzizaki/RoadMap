                                            ðŸ”¹ Response Transformation in API Gateway  

 ðŸ“Œ What is Response Transformation?  
Response transformation in an API Gateway modifies the format,
 structure, or content of responses before sending them back to the client. 
 
This is useful for:  
- Standardizing responses (e.g., converting XML to JSON).  
- Masking sensitive data (e.g., removing confidential fields).  
- Enhancing responses (e.g., adding metadata or timestamps).  
- Compressing data (e.g., gzip compression).

                                ðŸ”¹ How to Implement Response Transformation in Nginx API Gateway?  

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 âœ… 1. Modify JSON Responses (Using `lua-nginx-module`)  

To manipulate JSON responses dynamically, use the Lua module (`ngx_lua`):  

 ðŸ”¹ Example: Removing Sensitive Fields
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend_service;
    
    # Enable Lua for response transformation
    header_filter_by_lua_block {
        ngx.header["X-Processed-By"] = "API Gateway"
    }

    body_filter_by_lua_block {
        local cjson = require "cjson"
        local body = ngx.arg[1]
        if body then
            local success, data = pcall(cjson.decode, body)
            if success and type(data) == "table" then
                data["password"] = nil  -- Remove password field
                data["ssn"] = nil  -- Remove sensitive data
                ngx.arg[1] = cjson.encode(data)
            end
        end
    }
}
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
âœ… What This Does:  
- Adds a custom response header (`X-Processed-By`).  
- Removes sensitive fields (`password`, `ssn`) from JSON responses.  

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 âœ… 2. Convert XML to JSON (For Standardized Responses)  

If the backend returns XML, but the API should serve JSON, we can transform it:  

 ðŸ”¹ Example: XML to JSON Transformation
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend_service;
    
    body_filter_by_lua_block {
        local xml2lua = require "xml2lua"
        local handler = require "xmlhandler.tree"
        local cjson = require "cjson"
        local body = ngx.arg[1]

        if body and body:match("^<") then
            local parser = xml2lua.parser(handler)
            parser:parse(body)
            ngx.arg[1] = cjson.encode(handler.root)  -- Convert XML to JSON
        end
    }
}
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
âœ… What This Does:  
- Detects XML responses and converts them to JSON before sending them to the client.  

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 âœ… 3. Add Metadata to Responses (Timestamp & Request ID)  

To enhance responses, we can add request tracking and timestamps:  

 ðŸ”¹ Example: Inject Metadata
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
header_filter_by_lua_block {
    ngx.header["X-Request-ID"] = ngx.var.request_id
    ngx.header["X-Timestamp"] = ngx.time()
}
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
âœ… What This Does:  
- Adds `X-Request-ID` (unique request identifier).  
- Adds `X-Timestamp` (UNIX timestamp).  

_________________________________________________________________________________ 
 âœ… 4. Response Compression (Gzip for Faster Responses)

Enable Gzip compression to reduce payload size:  
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
server {
    gzip on;
    gzip_types application/json text/plain text/xml;
    gzip_comp_level 5;
}
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
âœ… What This Does:  
- Compresses responses to improve performance.  
- Applies compression only to specific MIME types (JSON, XML, text).

âœ… Modify JSON responses (remove sensitive fields, add headers).  
âœ… Convert XML to JSON (ensure standardized API responses).  
âœ… Inject metadata (timestamps, request tracking).  
âœ… Compress responses (faster data transmission).
