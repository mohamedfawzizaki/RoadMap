                                             Database Replication in MySQL 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                            
                                             1. What is MySQL Replication?

MySQL replication is a process that enables data from one database server (Primary/Master)
 to be copied automatically to one or more database servers (Replica/Slave). 
 
This helps in load balancing, fault tolerance, backups, and real-time analytics.

                                             2. Types of MySQL Replication

 a. Asynchronous Replication (Default)
      - The primary server writes changes to the binary log.
      - Replica reads the log and applies changes.
      - There is a slight delay between master and replica.

 b. Semi-Synchronous Replication
      - The master waits for at least one replica to acknowledge receiving the transaction before committing.
      - Ensures higher data consistency but may slightly impact performance.

 c. Group Replication (Multi-Primary)
      - Multiple servers act as masters.
      - Provides high availability and automatic failover.

                        |__________________|___________________________________________________________________|
                        | Primary (Master) | The source database that writes data.                             |
                        | Replica (Slave)  | The server that copies data from the master.                      |
                        | Binary Log       | The log that records all changes on the master.                   |
                        | Relay Log        | The log stored on the replica that contains executed queries.     |
                        | IO Thread        | Reads the master’s binary log and writes it to the relay log.     |
                        | SQL Thread       | Reads the relay log and applies changes to the replica database.  |

                                             4. Configuring MySQL Replication

 Step 1: Configure the Master Server
1. Edit MySQL Configuration File  
   Modify the `my.cnf` file (Linux) or `my.ini` file (Windows).
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````ini
   [mysqld]
   server-id=1
   log_bin=mysql-bin
   binlog_do_db=my_database   Specify which database to replicate
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

2. Restart MySQL Service
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
   sudo systemctl restart mysql
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

3. Create a Replication User
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'replica_password';
   GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

4. Lock Tables and Take a Backup
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
   SHOW MASTER STATUS;
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

   Note down:
   - File: `mysql-bin.000001`
   - Position: `12345`

5. Export Database for Initial Sync
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
   mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases --master-data > master_backup.sql
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                Step 2: Configure the Replica Server

1. Edit the MySQL Configuration File  
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````ini
   [mysqld]
   server-id=2
   relay-log=relay-bin
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

2. Restart MySQL Service
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
   sudo systemctl restart mysql
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

3. Import the Master’s Backup
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
   mysql -u root -p < master_backup.sql
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

4. Configure Replication on Replica
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   CHANGE MASTER TO
   MASTER_HOST='192.168.1.100',  -- Replace with Master IP
   MASTER_USER='replica_user',
   MASTER_PASSWORD='replica_password',
   MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001',  -- File from master status
   MASTER_LOG_POS=12345;  -- Position from master status
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

5. Start Replication
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   START SLAVE;
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

6. Check Replication Status
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

                                                   5. Monitoring Replication

 Checking Master Status
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Confirms if binary logging is active.

 Checking Replica Status
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Look for:
  - Slave_IO_Running: Yes
  - Slave_SQL_Running: Yes
  - Seconds_Behind_Master: 0 (Indicates no delay)

 Check Process List
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Displays running threads, including replication threads.

|_______________________________|_______________________|____________________________________________________________|
| `Could not connect to master` | Wrong credentials/IP  | Verify `CHANGE MASTER TO` values.                          |
| `Duplicate entry for key`     | Data inconsistency    | Resync the replica using backup.                           |
| `Relay log corrupted`         | Disk issue            | Reset replication: `STOP SLAVE; RESET SLAVE; START SLAVE;` |
| `Slave_SQL_Running: No`       | Query failure         | `SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G;` and check `Last_SQL_Error`.         |

                                             7. Advanced Replication Concepts

 a. Multi-Source Replication
- One replica can receive updates from multiple masters.
- Useful for consolidating data from multiple sources.

 b. Multi-Primary (Active-Active) Replication
- Uses Group Replication to allow multiple masters.
- Requires conflict resolution mechanisms.

 c. Delayed Replication
- Replicas apply changes with a delay (e.g., 1 hour).
- Useful for disaster recovery.
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
  CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_DELAY = 3600;
  ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

                              |____________________|________________________________________________|
                              | Full Backup        | `mysqldump --single-transaction --master-data` |
                              | Physical Backup    | `rsync /var/lib/mysql` (Stop MySQL first)      |
                              | Incremental Backup | Binary logs                                    |

                                             9. Failover and High Availability
 a. Manual Failover
1. Promote the replica to master:
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````sql
   STOP SLAVE;
   RESET SLAVE ALL;
   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
2. Redirect application traffic to the new master.

 b. Automatic Failover
- Use MySQL Router or Orchestrator.
- HAProxy can be used for automatic failover in master-slave setups.

                                                      Conclusion

MySQL Replication is an essential technique for scalability, high availability, and disaster recovery. 
Choosing the right replication type depends on your performance needs, consistency requirements, and failover strategy.
