                                                /etc/mysql/conf.d/
                                                =================

Your `/etc/mysql/conf.d/` directory contains the following files:  

1. `mysql.cnf`  
   - This file contains configuration settings for the MySQL client (such as the `mysql` command-line tool).  
   - Example content:
     ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````ini
     [mysql]
     default-character-set = utf8mb4
     ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

2. `mysqldump.cnf`  
   - This file is used to configure `mysqldump`, the MySQL backup tool.  
   - Example content:
     ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````ini
     [mysqldump]
     quick
     max_allowed_packet = 64M
     ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 What Does This Mean?
- The `conf.d/` directory is mainly for client-side configuration.
- Server settings (for the MySQL daemon) are usually inside `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`.
