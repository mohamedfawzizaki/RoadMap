                           # The null safe operator provides an elegant solution to the problem of null handling in PHP. 
                           # It allows direct access to properties or method calls on potentially null objects without encountering null pointer exceptions. 
                           # If the object is null, the null safe operator simply returns null instead of throwing an error.
