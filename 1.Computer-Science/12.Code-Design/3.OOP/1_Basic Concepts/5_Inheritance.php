Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

Overriding Inherited Methods
Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class.









<?php
class Fruit {
  public $name;
  public $color;
  public function __construct($name, $color) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->color = $color;
  }
  protected function intro() {
    echo "The fruit is {$this->name} and the color is {$this->color}.";
  }
}

class Strawberry extends Fruit {
  public function message() {
    // Call protected method from within derived class - OK
    $this -> intro();
  }
}

$strawberry = new Strawberry("Strawberry", "red"); // OK. __construct() is public
$strawberry->message(); // OK. message() is public and it calls intro() (which is protected) from within the derived class
?>
