                                                      ======

VMware is a leading provider of virtualization and cloud computing technologies.
Virtualization allows you to run multiple operating systems on a
 single physical machine by creating virtual machines (VMs) that share the hardware resources.
VMware provides various products for server virtualization, desktop virtualization,
 cloud management, and software-defined data centers.

                                               Core VMware Concepts

1.Hypervisor  
      VMware products use two types of hypervisors:
         - Type 1 Hypervisor: Runs directly on the hardware without a host operating system (e.g., VMware ESXi).
         - Type 2 Hypervisor: Runs on top of an existing host operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion).

2.Virtual Machine (VM)  
      A VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.
      Each VM runs its own operating system and applications while sharing the underlying physical hardware with other VMs.

3.vMotion  
      VMware's live migration feature, which allows you to move running VMs from one physical host to another without downtime.

4.High Availability (HA)  
      VMware HA ensures that if a host fails, the VMs running on that host are automatically restarted on other available hosts.

5.Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)  
      DRS balances workloads across hosts in a cluster by automatically migrating VMs to optimize performance and resource utilization.

                                            File Types Used by VMware

1.`.vmx`   – VM configuration file. 
2.`.vmdk`  – Virtual disk file. 
3.`.nvram` – VM BIOS/UEFI settings. 
4.`.vmxf`  – Team configuration file for VM teams. 
5.`.log`   – Log files for the VM. 
6.`.vmss`  – VM suspend state file.

                                        Location of VMware Files in Linux

- VMware Workstation:  
         Default location for virtual machine files is in the user’s home directory:  
         `````````````````````````````````````bash
         ~/vmware/<VM_name>/
         `````````````````````````````````````

- VMware ESXi:  
         On ESXi hosts, VM files are stored on datastores, which are typically formatted using VMFS (VMware File System).

                                       Advantages of VMware Virtualization

1.Resource Optimization  
         - Allows better utilization of physical hardware by running multiple VMs on a single server.
   
2.Scalability  
         - Easily scale up by adding more physical resources or scaling out by adding more hosts.

3.High Availability  
         - Ensures business continuity by automatically restarting VMs in case of hardware failure.

4.Flexibility  
         - Run different operating systems on the same hardware, enabling cross-platform development and testing.

5.Cost Efficiency  
         - Reduces hardware costs and energy consumption by consolidating multiple physical servers into virtual ones.
