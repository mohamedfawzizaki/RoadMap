                                                        VMware ESXi 
                                                        ===========

VMware ESXi (Elastic Sky X Integrated) is a bare-metal hypervisor designed to run virtual machines (VMs) on physical servers.
It is a key component of VMware's virtualization suite and forms the foundation of the vSphere ecosystem.
ESXi abstracts physical server hardware to enable the efficient
 utilization of resources like CPU, memory, storage, and network across multiple VMs.

                                              Key Components of ESXi

1.VMkernel:
        - The core of ESXi, responsible for managing hardware resources.
        - Provides abstraction and isolation for VMs.
        - Handles processes like scheduling, memory management, and I/O operations.

2.Host Management:
        - Configured via the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) or the vSphere Client.
        - Supports remote management using SSH, APIs, or vCenter Server.

3.Datastores:
        - Storage containers used to hold VM files, such as virtual disks, configuration files, and snapshots.
        - Supports multiple storage types:
            - Local disks
            - Network Attached Storage (NAS)
            - Storage Area Networks (SANs) using iSCSI, Fibre Channel, or NFS.

4.Networking:
        - Virtual switches (vSwitches) enable network connectivity for VMs.
        - Supports advanced features like VLANs, NIC teaming, and traffic shaping.

                                                Installing ESXi

1.Download the ISO:
        - Obtain the ESXi installer from the [VMware website](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html).

2.Prepare the Server:
        - Verify hardware compatibility.
        - Create a bootable USB or DVD with the ESXi installer.

3.Boot from Installation Media:
        - Boot the physical server from the installation media.
        - Follow the prompts to install ESXi on the server.

4.Initial Configuration:
        - Set a root password.
        - Configure basic network settings (IP address, gateway, DNS).
