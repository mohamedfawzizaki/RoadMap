                                                  VMware vCenter 
                                                  ==============

VMware vCenter Server is a centralized management platform for VMware's vSphere environments.
It allows administrators to manage multiple ESXi
 hosts and virtual machines (VMs) from a single interface, providing advanced 
 capabilities like resource allocation, automation, monitoring, and high availability.

                                              Deploying vCenter Server

 1.Deploying vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA)
        - VMware vCSA is a prepackaged virtual appliance running on Photon OS.
        - It eliminates the need for a separate Windows Server installation.

        Steps:
                1.Download the vCSA ISO from the VMware website.
                2.Mount the ISO on a local system.
                3.Use the GUI installer to deploy the vCSA on an ESXi host or vSphere environment.
                4.Configure networking, time synchronization, and SSO during deployment.

 2.Configuring vCenter
        - Access the vCenter Server through the vSphere Client.
        - Add ESXi hosts to vCenter for centralized management.
        - Configure clusters, resource pools, and datastores.
