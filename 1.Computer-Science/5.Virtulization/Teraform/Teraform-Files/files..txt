                                                      Terraform Files
                                                      ================ 

In Terraform, files are organized in a structured way to manage infrastructure configurations.

These files define your infrastructure. 
They can be broken down into several types, with each type having a specific role.

Key Files:
- `main.tf`: 
        - This is usually the primary file for your Terraform configuration. 
        - It typically contains the main blocks such as `provider`, `resource`, `module`, and `output`.
- `variables.tf`: 
        - This file is used to define input variables that can be passed to your configuration. 
        - You can declare variable types, default values, descriptions, etc.
- `outputs.tf`: 
        - This file contains the `output` blocks that will display the results
          after applying the configuration (e.g., IP addresses, resource IDs).
- `terraform.tfvars`: 
        - This file is where you can define values for input variables that are declared in `variables.tf`. 
        - It’s a convenient way to define defaults or sensitive data (like credentials) for the variables.
- `provider.tf`: 
        - This file typically contains the configuration for the provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) 
          you're using to manage resources. It is optional but recommended for clarity.
- `resources.tf`: 
        - This file is commonly used to define resources (like EC2 instances or storage buckets). 
        - While not mandatory, it's common to separate the resources into a dedicated file for readability.
- `data.tf`: 
        - This file can contain data blocks that define external resources or services (such as existing AMIs, VPCs, etc.).

                                    1. Main Configuration File (`.tf` files)
Example:

              ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
              # main.tf
              provider "aws" {
                region = "us-west-2"
              }

              resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
                ami = "ami-123456"
                instance_type = "t2.micro"
              }

              output "instance_id" {
                value = aws_instance.my_instance.id
              }
              ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                             2. State Files

Terraform needs to keep track of the current state of your infrastructure, which is stored in a file called the state file. 
This is a critical part of Terraform's operation.

Key Files:
- `terraform.tfstate`: 
        - This file stores the state of the infrastructure after it has been applied. 
        - It is automatically created and updated by Terraform. 
        - This file is sensitive because it contains resource information such as IDs, values, and metadata.
- `terraform.tfstate.backup`: 
        - This is a backup of the most recent state file and is automatically
          generated to ensure that you can recover from a failure.

Example:
After running `terraform apply`, Terraform generates the `terraform.tfstate` file to track the state of resources.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                        3. Backend Configuration

Terraform can use remote backends to store the state file and lock it during runs. 
This is useful for team environments to ensure consistent infrastructure management.

Key Files:
- `backend.tf`: This file configures the backend that will store the state remotely (e.g., S3, Consul, etc.).

Example:

              ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
              # backend.tf
              terraform {
                backend "s3" {
                  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
                  key    = "path/to/state"
                  region = "us-west-2"
                }
              }
              ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                            4. Module Files

Modules are reusable and self-contained configurations that you can use to organize and abstract parts of your infrastructure.

Key Files:
- `modules/`: This is a directory where reusable modules are stored. 
              Each module contains its own `.tf` files defining resources and outputs.

Example:
You might have a directory structure like this:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
            modules/
              vpc/
                main.tf
                outputs.tf
                variables.tf
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In `main.tf` for the module, you'd define a VPC:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # modules/vpc/main.tf
            resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
              cidr_block = var.cidr_block
            }

            output "vpc_id" {
              value = aws_vpc.main.id
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                           5. Variables and Outputs

As mentioned earlier, `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` help manage configuration flexibility and outputs.

 Example of `variables.tf`:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # variables.tf
            variable "cidr_block" {
              description = "The CIDR block for the VPC"
              type        = string
              default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 Example of `outputs.tf`:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # outputs.tf
            output "vpc_id" {
              value = aws_vpc.main.id
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                              6. Provider Configuration

The provider configuration file (`provider.tf`) specifies how Terraform interacts
 with the cloud provider and any required authentication details.

 Example of `provider.tf` for AWS:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # provider.tf
            provider "aws" {
              region  = "us-west-2"
              profile = "my-profile"
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                      7. Local Configuration (`local-exec` and `remote-exec`)

You can configure local or remote provisioning scripts using the `local-exec` and
 `remote-exec` provisioners, which execute commands after resource creation.

 Example of `local-exec`:

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
              ami             = "ami-123456"
              instance_type   = "t2.micro"

              provisioner "local-exec" {
                command = "echo 'Instance created!'"
              }
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                8. Provider-Specific Files

Some providers may also have additional configuration files to support specific functionality,
 such as a `terraform-provider` configuration or a specific `aws` configuration file.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                9. Lock Files

- `.terraform.lock.hcl`: 
          - This file ensures that Terraform uses the exact same provider versions for every run,
            which is important for team collaboration and maintaining consistency.

 Example:
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # .terraform.lock.hcl
            provider "aws" {
              version = "3.50.0"
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                10. Workspace Files

Terraform uses workspaces to manage multiple versions of state for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).

 Key Files:
- `workspace.tf`: This file can be used to configure the workspace
                  when needed (though Terraform generally handles this through CLI commands).

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                      11. Auto-Approval and Plan Files

- `terraform.plan`: 
        This is the file generated after running `terraform plan`,
         which provides a detailed report of changes before they are applied.
- `terraform.apply`: 
        A typical `.tf` file isn't used for applying, but you can use flags
         like `-auto-approve` to skip confirmation during `terraform apply`.

# File Example for a Simple Terraform Project

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # main.tf
            provider "aws" {
              region = "us-west-2"
            }

            resource "aws_instance" "example" {
              ami           = "ami-123456"
              instance_type = "t2.micro"
            }

            output "instance_id" {
              value = aws_instance.example.id
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # variables.tf
            variable "instance_type" {
              type    = string
              default = "t2.micro"
            }
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````hcl
            # terraform.tfvars
            instance_type = "t2.medium"
            ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
