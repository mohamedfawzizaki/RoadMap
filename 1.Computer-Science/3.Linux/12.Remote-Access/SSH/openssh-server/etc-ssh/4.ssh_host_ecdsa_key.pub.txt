#### 📌 **What is `ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`?**  
- It is the **public key** corresponding to the **private host key** (`ssh_host_ecdsa_key`).  
- This key is used to **authenticate the server** during SSH connections.  
- Clients use it to verify the server’s identity when connecting.

---

### 📂 **Where is it Located?**  
- The public key is stored in:
  ```bash
  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
  ```
- The private key (`ssh_host_ecdsa_key`) is in the same directory.

### 🔑 **Key Properties**  
| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Algorithm** | ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) |
| **File Type** | Public Key |
| **Permissions** | Should be **644** (`-rw-r--r--`) |
| **Location** | `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub` |
| **Purpose** | Server authentication for SSH |

### 🛠 **How is it Used?**  
When a client connects to an SSH server:
1. The server sends its **public key** (`ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`) to the client.
2. The client checks if the key matches a previously saved key in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
3. If the key matches, the client trusts the server and establishes a secure connection.

---

### 🔍 **Checking the Key**  
You can view the public key using:
```bash
cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```
The output will look something like this:
```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBJxt...
```

To check file permissions:
```bash
ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```
Expected output:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 162 Aug 25 10:00 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```

---

### ⚠️ **Security Notes**  
✅ **It is safe to share the public key (`ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub`).**  
✅ Ensure file permissions are **644**:
```bash
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
```
✅ **Do NOT modify the key manually** unless regenerating SSH host keys.

### 🔄 **Regenerating SSH Host Keys (If Needed)**  
If the host keys are missing or compromised, you can regenerate them:
```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -N ""
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
