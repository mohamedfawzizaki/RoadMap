                                                `/etc/cron.allow`
                                              ===================  
The `/etc/cron.allow` file is used to control access to the cron system for scheduling jobs.
It specifies which users are permitted to use the `cron` command to set up their own cron jobs.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Purpose of `/etc/cron.allow`

The file provides an explicit allow list of users who can create and manage cron jobs.
If it exists, only the users listed in this file are allowed to use the `crontab` command.
This enhances system security by limiting cron usage to trusted users.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Behavior Based on File Existence

1.If `/etc/cron.allow` exists:
        - Only users listed in this file can create and manage cron jobs.
        - All other users are denied access, even if they are not listed in `/etc/cron.deny`.

2.If `/etc/cron.allow` does not exist but `/etc/cron.deny` exists:
        - Any user not listed in `/etc/cron.deny` is allowed to create and manage cron jobs.

3.If neither `/etc/cron.allow` nor `/etc/cron.deny` exists:
        - By default, all users are allowed to create and manage cron jobs.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Format of `/etc/cron.allow`

- Each line in the file should contain the username of a permitted user.
- Comments are not allowed.
- Example `/etc/cron.allow` file:

  ```````````````````````````````````````plaintext
  root
  alice
  bob
  ```````````````````````````````````````

  In this example:
  - Only the users `root`, `alice`, and `bob` are allowed to use the `cron` command.
  - All other users are denied access.

Example: Testing `/etc/cron.allow`

Step 1: Create the `/etc/cron.allow` file
                    ```````````````````````````````````````bash
                    sudo nano /etc/cron.allow
                    ```````````````````````````````````````

                    Add the following lines:
                    ```````````````````````````````````````plaintext
                    root
                    john
                    ```````````````````````````````````````

Step 2: Test cron access for users

            1.For a listed user (e.g., `john`):
                    ```````````````````````````````````````bash
                    su - john
                    crontab -e
                    ```````````````````````````````````````
                    The user will be able to edit their crontab.

            2.For an unlisted user (e.g., `mary`):
                    ```````````````````````````````````````bash
                    su - mary
                    crontab -e
                    ```````````````````````````````````````
                    Output:
                    ```````````````````````````````````````plaintext
                    You (mary) are not allowed to use this program (crontab)
                    See crontab(1) for more information
                    ```````````````````````````````````````

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Managing Cron Access with `/etc/cron.allow`

- To allow a new user:   Add the username to `/etc/cron.allow`.
  
- To remove access for a user:  Remove the username from `/etc/cron.allow`.

Security Considerations

1.Restrict Cron Usage to Trusted Users  
   Limiting cron access reduces the risk of resource abuse and unmonitored
    background jobs that could harm system performance or security.

2.File Permissions  
   Ensure that `/etc/cron.allow` has 
   proper permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications:
            ```````````````````````````````````````bash
            sudo chmod 600 /etc/cron.allow
            sudo chown root:root /etc/cron.allow
            ```````````````````````````````````````
