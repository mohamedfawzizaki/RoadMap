1.Standard Input (stdin)  '0' 
 
  
 
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      cat < input.txt
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

2.Standard Output (stdout)    '1'

 
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
      echo "Hello, World!" 1> output.txt

      echo "Hello, World!" >> output.txt
      echo "Hello, World!" 1>> output.txt
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

3.Standard Error (stderr)   '2'

 
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      ls non_existent_file 2> error.log
      ls non_existent_file 2>> error.log
      ./script.sh 1>> success.txt 2>> error.txt
      ./script.sh 1>> output.txt 2>>&1                to the same file

      ls non_existent_file > output.log 2>&1
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

Combining `stdout` and `stderr`


      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      command > output.log 2>&1
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      ls non_existent_file > output.log 2>&1
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

Pipes and Streams


      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      ls non_existent_file 2>&1 | tee error.log
      ``````````````````````````````````````````

File Stream Redirection


- Redirecting `stdin` from a file:
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      command < input.txt
      ``````````````````````````````````````````
      The `command` will take its input from the `input.txt` file instead of the terminal.

- Redirecting `stdout` to a file:
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      command > output.txt
      ``````````````````````````````````````````
      The output of `command` is saved in `output.txt`.

- Redirecting `stderr` to a file:
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      command 2> error.txt
      ``````````````````````````````````````````
      This saves error messages in `error.txt`.

- Redirecting both `stdout` and `stderr` to the same file:
      ``````````````````````````````````````````bash
      command > output.txt 2>&1
      ``````````````````````````````````````````
