## What is a ReplicationController?

A **ReplicationController (RC)** ensures that a specified number of **pod replicas** are running at any given time.

* If too few pods are running, it **creates** new ones.
* If too many pods are running, it **deletes** excess pods.
* If pods fail or are terminated, it **replaces** them.

---

## Purpose

* Maintain **high availability** by running multiple copies of a pod.
* Provide **self-healing** to automatically replace failed pods.
* Manage **scaling** by increasing or decreasing pod replicas.

## Key Characteristics

| Feature                                   | Description                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ensures desired number of replicas        | Keeps specified pod replicas running                                                |
| Works with Pods directly                  | Manages pods using label selectors                                                  |
| Stateless controller                      | Does not manage pod updates or rolling upgrades                                     |
| Superseded by ReplicaSet (and Deployment) | ReplicaSet offers better selector management, Deployment offers declarative updates |

## Anatomy of a ReplicationController

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: my-rc
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

---

## Important Fields

* **`replicas`**: Number of desired pod replicas.
* **`selector`**: Label selector to identify which pods are managed.
* **`template`**: Pod template used to create pods if needed.

---

## How It Works

* The RC continuously watches pods matching its selector.
* When pods fall below the desired count, it creates new pods.
* When pods exceed the count, it deletes extras.
* It replaces pods that crash or are deleted.

---

## Limitations of ReplicationController

* Uses **equality-based selectors** only (no set-based selectors).
* Does **not support rolling updates** or declarative updates.
* Replaced in most cases by **ReplicaSet** and **Deployment** for advanced features.

## ReplicaSet vs ReplicationController

| Feature         | ReplicationController     | ReplicaSet                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Label selectors | Equality-based only       | Equality + set-based                   |
| Rolling updates | Not supported             | Not supported (but used by Deployment) |
| Usage           | Legacy, mostly deprecated | Modern, recommended                    |

---

## Example Usage Scenario

* Use a ReplicationController if you want simple replication without updates.
* Use ReplicaSet for newer setups.
* Use Deployment for declarative management with rolling updates.

---

## Commands

* Create:

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicationcontroller.yaml
```

* Get status:

```bash
kubectl get rc
kubectl describe rc my-rc
```

* Scale:

```bash
kubectl scale rc my-rc --replicas=5
```

* Delete:

```bash
kubectl delete rc my-rc
```

## Summary

| Aspect                                  | Details                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Ensures pods count                      | Maintains specified number of pod replicas |
| Uses label selectors                    | Matches pods to manage                     |
| No rolling updates                      | Lacks update strategy                      |
| Superseded by ReplicaSet and Deployment | For most use cases, these are preferred    |
