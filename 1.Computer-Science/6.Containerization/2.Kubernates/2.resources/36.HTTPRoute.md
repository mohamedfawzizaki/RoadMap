# What is HTTPRoute?

* **HTTPRoute** is a Kubernetes resource that defines how HTTP(S) traffic is routed to backend services.
* It works alongside a **Gateway** resource that handles network-level ingress.
* HTTPRoute allows detailed rules for:

  * Matching HTTP requests (hostnames, paths, headers, methods, query params).
  * Routing matched requests to one or more backend services.
  * Traffic splitting and weight-based routing.
  * Advanced features like request rewriting, retries, timeouts, and filters.

---

# Why HTTPRoute?

* Traditional Ingress has limited routing and extension capabilities.
* HTTPRoute provides a modular, expressive API for HTTP traffic routing.
* Enables better multi-tenant support, route sharing, and delegation.
* Decouples routing rules from network ingress (handled by Gateway).

---

# HTTPRoute API Version and Kind

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPRoute
```

*(Note: API versions may vary as Gateway API evolves, e.g., v1beta1 in newer Kubernetes.)*

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `metadata.name`     | Name of the HTTPRoute                                                                |

| `rules.filters`     | Optional filters applied to requests (header modification, URL rewrite, retry, etc.) |
| `rules.backendRefs` | List of backend services with ports and optional weights for traffic splitting       |

---

# Matching Criteria (Rules → Matches)

* **Path matching:** Exact, Prefix, or Regular Expression.
* **Header matching:** Match HTTP headers (name, value, present, regex).
* **Method matching:** Match HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
* **Query parameter matching:** Match specific query params.
* **Multiple matches:** Combined with AND logic.

---

# Filters (Rules → Filters)

Filters allow modifying requests or responses and other behaviors:

| Filter Type             | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `RequestHeaderModifier` | Add, set, or remove HTTP request headers     |
| `RequestRedirect`       | Redirect HTTP requests (e.g., HTTP to HTTPS) |
| `RequestMirror`         | Mirror requests to another backend           |
| `URLRewrite`            | Rewrite URL path or hostname                 |
| `Retry`                 | Define retry policies for failed requests    |

---

# BackendRefs and Traffic Splitting

* You can specify multiple backend services in `backendRefs` with optional weights.
* Enables **traffic splitting** for canary releases or A/B testing.
* Weight values are integers, total weights normalized for routing percentage.

---

# Example: Simple HTTPRoute

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: simple-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: example-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "myapp.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: Prefix
        value: "/"
    backendRefs:
    - name: myapp-service
      port: 80
```

---

# ParentRefs and Multi-Gateway Support

* `parentRefs` link the HTTPRoute to one or more Gateways.
* This allows the same route to be attached to multiple gateways (multi-tenant or multi-cluster setups).

---

# Advanced Features

* **Multi-namespace routes:** Routes can select backend services in other namespaces (with permission).
* **Header-based routing:** Route requests differently based on header content.
* **Delegation:** Routes can delegate to other routes, enabling hierarchical routing configs.
* **Filters:** Rich request/response manipulation.
* **Traffic policies:** Timeout, retries, mirroring, etc., are being added or supported by controllers.

Absolutely! Here's a detailed **end-to-end explanation of how HTTPRoute works together with Gateway and GatewayClass** in Kubernetes Gateway API:

---

# Overview: Gateway API Components Interaction

| Resource         | Role                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GatewayClass** | Defines the *type* of Gateway (the controller managing it)                                 |
| **Gateway**      | Represents a network gateway/load balancer instance, exposing listeners (ports, protocols) |
| **HTTPRoute**    | Defines HTTP-specific routing rules bound to a Gateway's listener                          |

---

# Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. **Define a GatewayClass**

* This resource declares a class of Gateways.
* Specifies the **controller** responsible for implementing Gateways of this class.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: example-gatewayclass
spec:
  controller: example.net/gateway-controller
```

* The controller string tells Kubernetes which controller reconciles Gateways of this class.
* Multiple GatewayClasses can coexist for different controllers.

---

### 2. **Create a Gateway referencing GatewayClass**

* Gateway is a cluster-scoped resource representing the actual gateway instance.
* It references the GatewayClass by name (`gatewayClassName`).
* Defines **listeners**, specifying:

  * Which protocol(s) (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, etc.)
  * Ports to listen on
  * Hostnames (optional)
  * TLS settings (certificates)
  * Which namespaces Routes can come from (`allowedRoutes`)

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: example-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: example-gatewayclass
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
```

* The controller watches Gateway objects belonging to its GatewayClass.
* The controller configures the underlying network load balancer or proxy according to Gateway spec.

---

### 3. **Create HTTPRoute(s) bound to Gateway**

* HTTPRoute is a namespaced resource defining HTTP routing rules.
* It binds to one or more Gateways via `parentRefs`.
* Specifies:

  * Which hostnames the route applies to
  * Routing rules (paths, headers, methods)
  * Filters (header modification, URL rewrite, etc.)
  * BackendRefs to services (with ports and optional weights for traffic splitting)

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: example-httproute
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: example-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: Prefix
        value: "/"
    backendRefs:
    - name: my-service
      port: 80
```

* This HTTPRoute tells the Gateway "For requests on `example.com` and path starting with `/`, route to `my-service:80`."

---

### 4. **How the Pieces Fit Together at Runtime**

* The **Gateway controller** reconciles GatewayClass and Gateway objects.
* It sets up the network infrastructure (e.g., cloud LB, ingress proxy) per Gateway listeners.
* The controller watches **HTTPRoute** resources bound to Gateways it manages.
* For each Gateway listener, it:

  * Filters HTTPRoutes bound to it (`parentRefs` match Gateway).
  * Collects routes matching listener protocol and hostname.
  * Merges routing rules from all matching HTTPRoutes.
* The controller programs routing rules into the underlying proxy/load balancer:

  * Host/path matching
  * Backend service targets
  * Filters and traffic policies (if supported)

---

### 5. **Traffic Flow at Runtime**

* Client sends HTTP request to Gateway's external IP or hostname.
* The Gateway (network proxy/load balancer) receives the request on configured port.
* Based on hostname, path, headers, the Gateway uses routing rules defined by bound HTTPRoutes.
* Requests are forwarded to one or more backend services as per HTTPRoute’s backendRefs.
* Optional features like retries, redirects, header modification happen according to HTTPRoute filters.

# Benefits of this Design

* **Extensibility:** Multiple GatewayClasses/controllers can coexist.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Gateway handles network layer; HTTPRoute handles application routing.
* **Multi-tenancy:** AllowedRoutes restrict namespaces that can attach routes.
* **Protocol Agnostic:** Gateways support multiple protocols; HTTPRoute focuses on HTTP(S).
* **Rich Routing:** HTTPRoute supports complex matching, filters, traffic splitting, retries, etc.
* **Multi-Gateway Binding:** HTTPRoutes can bind to multiple Gateways if needed.
