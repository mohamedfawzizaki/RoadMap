## What is a ReplicaSet?

A **ReplicaSet (RS)** is a Kubernetes controller that ensures a specified number of identical pod replicas are running at any given time.

* It continuously monitors the number of pods matching its selector.
* Creates or deletes pods to maintain the desired replica count.
* Supports **set-based label selectors** for flexible pod matching.

> ReplicaSet is the next-generation replacement for **ReplicationController**, with enhanced selector capabilities.

---

## Purpose

* Maintain a stable number of pod replicas.
* Provide high availability and fault tolerance.
* Support dynamic scaling by adjusting replica counts.
* Used as the underlying controller for **Deployments** (which add rolling updates and declarative management).

## Anatomy of a ReplicaSet

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Key Fields

| Field      | Description                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replicas` | Number of desired pod replicas                                                      |
| `selector` | Label selector to identify pods managed (supports matchLabels and matchExpressions) |
| `template` | Pod template used to create new pods                                                |

---

## Label Selectors

ReplicaSet supports **set-based selectors** in addition to equality-based selectors, allowing:

* `matchLabels`: Exact label matches (key-value)
* `matchExpressions`: Complex conditions like `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`

Example:

```yaml
selector:
  matchExpressions:
  - key: tier
    operator: In
    values:
    - frontend
    - backend
```

---

## How ReplicaSet Works

* Watches pods that match its selector.
* Creates pods if count is below desired replicas.
* Deletes pods if count is above desired replicas.
* Replaces pods that fail or terminate.
* Does **not** perform rolling updates itself (Deployments handle that).

## ReplicaSet vs ReplicationController

| Feature         | ReplicationController | ReplicaSet                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Selector type   | Equality-based only   | Equality + Set-based                        |
| Rolling updates | No                    | No (used by Deployment for rolling updates) |
| Usage           | Legacy                | Modern and preferred                        |

---

## Common Use Cases

* Directly managing pod replicas without rollout strategies.
* Backing controller for **Deployments**.
* Situations requiring advanced selector logic.

---

## Managing ReplicaSets

* **Create/Apply**

```bash
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml
```

* **Get**

```bash
kubectl get rs
kubectl describe rs my-replicaset
```

* **Scale**

```bash
kubectl scale rs my-replicaset --replicas=5
```

* **Delete**

```bash
kubectl delete rs my-replicaset
```

---

## Interaction with Deployments

* You usually **donâ€™t manage ReplicaSets directly**.
* Deployments create and manage ReplicaSets for rolling updates and declarative updates.
* ReplicaSets owned by Deployments are automatically updated and cleaned up.

---

## Example: Scale ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl scale replicaset my-replicaset --replicas=10
```

| Aspect          | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Role            | Ensure a stable set of pod replicas        |
| Selector        | Supports equality and set-based selectors  |
| Pods Managed    | Creates/deletes pods to match replicas     |
| Rolling Updates | Not supported directly (use Deployments)   |
| Relationship    | ReplicaSets usually managed by Deployments |
