                                                 Network protocols
                                              =======================
Network protocols are standardized rules and conventions that govern
 how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted across networks.

They ensure that devices can communicate efficiently, securely, and without errors.

Below is a detailed exploration of network protocols, 
categorized based on their functionality and OSI layer association:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 e.Network Layer Protocols (Layer 3)
      - These protocols determine how data packets are routed across networks.
      - Append the IP address to the packet.

            - Provides addressing and routing.
            - IPv4: Uses 32 -bit addresses.
            - IPv6: Uses 128-bit addresses for a larger address space.

      - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
            - Sends error messages and operational information.
            - Used in tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.

      - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
            - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

      - RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol):
            - Maps MAC addresses to IP addresses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 f.Data Link Layer Protocols (Layer 2)
      - These protocols define how data is framed and transmitted over physical links.

      - Ethernet:
            - Standard for wired LAN communication.
            - Defines how devices on a network access and share data.
            - Append the MAC address to the packet.

      - PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
            - Used in direct communication between two nodes, like over a modem.

      - Wi-Fi (802.11 standards):
            - Defines wireless LAN communication protocols.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 g.Physical Layer Protocols (Layer 1)
      - These protocols govern the transmission of raw bits over physical media.

      - DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):
            - Provides internet over telephone lines.

      - ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network):
            - Transmits voice, video, and data over digital lines.

      - Ethernet Standards (e.g., 100Base-T, 1000Base-T):
            - Define speed and cabling types.
