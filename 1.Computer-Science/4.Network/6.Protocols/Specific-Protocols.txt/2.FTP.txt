                                                FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  
                                                ============================

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer
 files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network, such as the internet. 
 
It allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a remote server,
 making it one of the oldest and most commonly used protocols for file transfers.

FTP operates on a client-server model, where the client initiates requests to the server to perform various file operations. 

The client can use an FTP client software (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP) to connect to the FTP server, authenticate, and transfer files.

                                                      How FTP Works

FTP uses two separate communication channels:
1. Control Channel:
      - Used to send commands and receive responses. 
      - This communication is typically done over port 21 (default).
2. Data Channel: 
      - Used for transferring actual file data. 
      - The port used for this channel can vary based on the connection mode (Active or Passive).

 Active Mode (PORT Mode):
- The client opens a random port (greater than 1024) and tells the server to connect to that port for the data transfer.
- The server will establish the data connection from its port 20 to the client’s specified port.

 Passive Mode (PASV Mode):
- The client initiates both the control and data connections. 
- The server opens a random port (greater than 1024) for the data connection and tells the client to connect to it.
- This mode is preferred when clients are behind firewalls
   or NAT (Network Address Translation) devices because it doesn't require inbound connections to the client's system.

                                                      FTP Commands

FTP clients send commands to FTP servers to interact with them. 
Some of the most common FTP commands include:

1. USER: Specifies the username for authentication.
   - Example: `USER username`

2. PASS: Specifies the password for authentication.
   - Example: `PASS password`

3. LIST: Lists files and directories in the current directory of the server.
   - Example: `LIST`

4. CWD: Changes the working directory on the server.
   - Example: `CWD /path/to/directory`

5. PWD: Displays the current working directory on the server.
   - Example: `PWD`

6. RETR: Retrieves (downloads) a file from the server.
   - Example: `RETR filename`

7. STOR: Stores (uploads) a file to the server.
   - Example: `STOR filename`

8. DELE: Deletes a file on the server.
   - Example: `DELE filename`

9. MKD: Creates a new directory on the server.
   - Example: `MKD new_directory`

10. RMD: Removes a directory from the server.
    - Example: `RMD old_directory`

11. QUIT: Closes the connection to the server.
    - Example: `QUIT`

                                                         FTP Response Codes

The server responds to commands with a three-digit code, followed by an optional text message. 

The response code can help the client understand the result of a command.

- 1xx (Positive Preliminary Response): The command was accepted, but further action is needed.
  - Example: `150 File status okay; about to open data connection.`

- 2xx (Positive Completion Response): The command was successfully completed.
  - Example: `200 Command okay.`

- 3xx (Positive Intermediate Response): The server is requesting further information from the client.
  - Example: `331 User name okay, need password.`

- 4xx (Transient Negative Completion Response): The command was not completed, but the error is temporary (e.g., network issues).
  - Example: `421 Service not available, closing control connection.`

- 5xx (Permanent Negative Completion Response): The command failed due to a permanent error.
  - Example: `550 Requested action not taken. File unavailable.`

                                                            FTP Modes

- ASCII Mode: 
      - Used for transferring text files. 
      - The FTP server and client will automatically convert newline characters to the appropriate format for the operating system (e.g., Windows uses `\r\n` while Unix-based systems use `\n`).
- Binary Mode: 
      - Used for transferring binary files (e.g., images, executables). 
      - No conversion occurs during the transfer, ensuring that the file is transferred exactly as it is.

To switch between modes:
- ASCII  : `TYPE A`
- Binary : `TYPE I`

                                                   Security and Encryption in FTP

By default, FTP does not provide encryption or secure authentication. 
All data (including credentials) is transmitted in clear text,
 making it vulnerable to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.

To secure FTP connections, a few variations of FTP have been developed:

1. FTPS (FTP Secure):
   - FTPS adds SSL/TLS encryption to FTP, providing secure communication and protecting both the control and data channels.
   - FTPS can operate in two modes:
     - Explicit FTPS: The client requests encryption explicitly by sending the `AUTH TLS` command before any data is transmitted.
     - Implicit FTPS: Encryption is automatically used, typically on port 990.

2. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol):
   - SFTP is a different protocol that is part of the SSH (Secure Shell) suite, offering secure file transfers over a secure channel. Unlike FTPS, which is FTP with encryption, SFTP is entirely different in its implementation and encryption.
   - SFTP encrypts both the control and data channels, ensuring that the entire session is secure.

                                                FTP Client-Server Communication Flow

1. Client Initiates Connection:
   - The client initiates a connection to the FTP server, typically over port 21.

2. Authentication:
   - The client sends the `USER` and `PASS` commands to provide a username and password for authentication.
   - The server responds with either a success message (e.g., `230 User logged in`) or an error (e.g., `530 Login incorrect`).

3. File Transfer or Management:
   - The client can issue commands like `RETR`, `STOR`, `LIST`, and `CWD` to manage files on the server.
   - The server responds to each command with appropriate status codes.

4. End Session:
   - The client can issue the `QUIT` command to end the session.

                                                         FTP Ports

- Port 21: Default port for FTP control channel (used for sending commands and receiving responses).
- Port 20: Default port for FTP data channel in active mode (used for transferring data).
- Ports 1024–65535: In passive mode, the server opens a random port for the data connection, which the client connects to.

                                                      FTP Use Cases

1. Website Management:
   - FTP is commonly used by webmasters to upload, download, and manage website files on web servers.

2. Data Backup:
   - Organizations use FTP to back up important data from local systems to remote servers.

3. Software Distribution:
   - Developers use FTP to distribute software updates or files to users, making it an essential tool for file sharing.

                                                    FTP Alternatives

While FTP is still widely used, modern alternatives are preferred for secure and efficient file transfers:
1. SFTP  : Secure, based on SSH.
2. FTPS  : FTP over SSL/TLS.
3. HTTP/S: For web-based file transfers (via file upload forms, for example).
4. Cloud storage services: Such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS S3.

                                                      Conclusion

FTP is a simple and widely used protocol for file transfer over a network. 
While it is an effective and established solution,
 its lack of built-in security has led to the adoption of secure variants such as FTPS and SFTP for more sensitive data transfers. 
 
With secure alternatives in place, FTP remains a valuable tool in various domains such as web management,
 data backups, and software distribution, especially when encryption or secure channels are implemented.
