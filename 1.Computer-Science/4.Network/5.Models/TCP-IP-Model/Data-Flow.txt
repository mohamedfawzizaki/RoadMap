                                                   Data Transmission Flow in TCP/IP

1. Application Layer: 
         - Data is generated by user applications and passed to the transport layer for segmentation and protocol management.
2. Transport Layer: 
         - The data is split into segments (in TCP) or packets (in UDP) and encapsulated with the appropriate header.
3. Internet Layer: 
         - The transport-layer segments are encapsulated into packets,
           addressed with the destination IP address, and routed across networks.
4. Network Interface Layer: 
         - The IP packets are framed into data link frames, and transmitted through the physical medium (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.).

At the receiving side, the data is processed in reverse order, from the Network Interface Layer up to the Application Layer.
