Definition:
      - Network Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version 
         of a network infrastructure, allowing multiple logical networks to coexist on a single physical network.
      - It abstracts the underlying hardware and presents a software-based view 
         of network resources to users, applications, and services.
      - This helps optimize network resources, improve scalability, and increase flexibility for network management.

      - Virtual Network Interface Cards (vNICs): 
                - These virtualized interfaces connect virtual machines (VMs) or 
                   other devices to virtual networks, similar to how physical NICs are used in physical machines.
      
      - Software-Defined Networking (SDN): 
                - SDN is often a key enabler of network virtualization.
                - It decouples the control plane (decision-making) from the 
                   data plane (traffic forwarding), allowing network configuration and management to be done centrally via software.
      
      - Network Function Virtualization (NFV): 
                - NFV is the process of virtualizing network functions
                   such as firewalls, load balancers, and intrusion detection systems.
                - These virtualized functions are deployed as software instead of hardware appliances.
      
      - Network Segmentation: 
                - Virtual networks can segment a physical network into isolated, 
                   secure logical networks, improving security, isolation, and traffic management.
      
      - Overlay Networks: 
                - These are virtual networks built over the physical infrastructure 
                   using tunneling protocols, often seen in technologies like VXLAN and NVGRE.
