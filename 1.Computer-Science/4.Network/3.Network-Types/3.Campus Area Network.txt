Campus Area Network (CAN)
        - A Campus Area Network connects multiple LANs within 
          a confined area like a university, business campus, or military base.

        Characteristics:
            - Covers larger areas than LANs but smaller than MANs.
            - High-speed connectivity optimized for internal communication.

        Examples:
            - University networks connecting classrooms, libraries, and labs.
            - Corporate campuses with centralized IT services.
