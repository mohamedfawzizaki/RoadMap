Definition:
    -> It is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, routers, switches, etc.) 
       that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and applications.
    -> Networks are the backbone of modern communication, enabling everything from 
       email and file sharing to video conferencing and internet access.
    -> Why Networks Are Essential:
            - Resource Sharing:  Centralized storage (e.g., servers), printers, and internet access.
            - Communication   :  Email, messaging, video conferencing.
            - Data Sharing    :  Collaboration through file transfers and shared drives.
            - Scalability     :  Growing or modifying systems to meet user needs.
