                                                 Network Topologies
                                              =======================
Network topologies refer to the arrangement or layout of various elements (nodes, links, devices) in a computer network.
It can be described physically, based on the actual hardware connections, or logically, based on how data flows.

Below is a detailed explanation of the types of network topologies:

 1.Physical Topologies:
        Physical topology refers to the actual placement of network devices and how they are connected via cables or wireless links.

        a.Bus Topology
              - Description:
                    - All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus) using drop lines and taps.
                    - Communication is broadcast, and each device listens to the transmission.
              - Advantages:
                    - Easy to set up and extend.
                    - Cost-effective for small networks.
              - Disadvantages:
                    - A failure in the central bus disrupts the entire network.
                    - Limited cable length and number of nodes.
                    - Data collisions increase with more devices.
              - Use Cases:
                    - Early Ethernet networks.
