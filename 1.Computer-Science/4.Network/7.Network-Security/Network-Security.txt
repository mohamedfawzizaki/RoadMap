                                               Network Security
                                              ===================
Definition:
       - Network Security is the practice of protecting the integrity, confidentiality, 
         and availability of data and resources as they are transmitted across or accessed through a network.

       - Network security involves implementing a range of policies, tools, and practices 
         to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure of data.

       - Network security covers both the hardware and software aspects of a network.

       - It also involves ensuring the proper monitoring, management, 
         and use of these systems to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats.

                                                 Types of Network Security
                                                 =========================
1.Firewall Security:
       - Firewalls are the first line of defense for any network.
       - They control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
       
       - Firewalls can be hardware or software-based and are often 
         placed at the entry point to the network to block unauthorized access.
       
       - Firewalls can operate at different layers, including the 
         application layer (Layer 7), transport layer (Layer 4), and network layer (Layer 3).

       Types of Firewalls:
              - Packet Filtering Firewall: 
                            -> Examines the header of packets to decide whether to allow or block them based on security rules.
              
              - Stateful Inspection Firewall: 
                            -> Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of packets.
              
              - Proxy Firewall: 
                            -> Acts as an intermediary between the client and server,
                               inspecting and forwarding packets based on rules.
              
              - Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): 
                            -> Offers more advanced features like application awareness, 
                                integrated intrusion prevention, and encrypted traffic inspection.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):
       - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) monitor network traffic to detect 
         suspicious activity and raise alerts when malicious behavior is identified.
       
       - Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are designed to actively prevent and 
         block potential attacks based on predefined security signatures or anomaly detection.
       
       - IDS and IPS can be host-based (HIDS) or network-based (NIDS) depending on where they are deployed in the network.
   
       - IDS/IPS Techniques:
              - Signature-Based Detection : Looks for known patterns of malicious activity (signatures).
              - Anomaly-Based Detection   : Identifies deviations from normal behavior to detect new or unknown threats.
              - Behavior-Based Detection  : Monitors network behavior for abnormal actions indicative of an attack.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3.Virtual Private Networks (VPN):
       Definition:
              - A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that enables 
                 a secure and private connection to a network over a public infrastructure such as the internet.
              
              - It creates a secure "tunnel" for data transmission, encrypting 
                 the data and masking the user’s IP address to ensure privacy, security, and data integrity.
              
              - VPNs are commonly used by individuals and organizations to secure 
                 their internet connections and access private networks remotely.

       How VPN Works

              1.Encryption: 
                     - VPN encrypts data before it is transmitted over the internet, 
                       ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read.
              2.Tunneling: 
                     - Data is sent through a secure "tunnel" using a protocol 
                       that ensures the transmission remains private and secure.
                     - This allows users to appear as if they are accessing the internet from a different location.
              3.IP Masking: 
                     - VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server.
                     - This provides anonymity and prevents websites and online services from tracking your real IP address.
              4.Authentication: 
                     - VPNs use various authentication mechanisms (username/password, certificates, etc.) 
                       to ensure that only authorized users can access the network.

       Types of VPNs
              --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
