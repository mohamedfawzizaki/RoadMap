                                  Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks 

 1. What is a DoS Attack?  
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack where an attacker overwhelms a system,
 server, or network with excessive requests, making it slow or completely unavailable for legitimate users.  

 üìå Key Characteristics of a DoS Attack  
‚úÖ Floods the target system with malicious traffic or heavy processing tasks.  
‚úÖ Exploits vulnerabilities to crash or degrade system performance.  
‚úÖ Typically launched from a single machine (unlike DDoS, which uses multiple machines).  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. Types of DoS Attacks  

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Volume-Based Attacks  
Goal: Consume the target‚Äôs bandwidth, making it unreachable.  
 üîπ UDP Flood
- Sends a massive number of UDP packets to random ports.  
- Overloads the system, causing high CPU usage.  
- Example:
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  hping3 --flood --udp -p 80 target.com
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  
 üîπ ICMP (Ping) Flood
- Attacker sends a large number of ICMP Echo Requests (pings) to overwhelm the system.  
- Example:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  ping -f -s 65500 target.com
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
  
 üîπ SYN Flood
- Exploits TCP handshake by sending half-open connections (SYN packets) without completing them.  
- Consumes server resources and prevents new connections.  
- Example:
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  hping3 --flood --syn -p 80 target.com
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application-Layer Attacks  
Goal: Overload an application‚Äôs processing capacity rather than network bandwidth.  
 üîπ HTTP Flood
- Sends a huge number of legitimate-looking HTTP requests to exhaust server processing.  
- Harder to detect because it mimics normal traffic.  
- Example using Curl:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  while true; do curl http://target.com; done
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 üîπ Slowloris Attack
- Opens many partial HTTP connections and keeps them open for a long time.  
- Prevents the server from handling real requests.  
- Example using Slowloris Tool:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
  slowloris target.com -p 80
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Protocol-Based Attacks  
Goal: Exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.  
 üîπ Ping of Death
- Sends oversized ICMP packets to crash the target system.  
- Modern systems have protections against it.  

 üîπ Teardrop Attack
- Sends malformed fragmented packets that the system fails to reassemble, causing a crash.

 3. Difference Between DoS & DDoS Attacks  

| Feature     | DoS Attack      | DDoS Attack |
| Source      | Single machine  | Multiple machines (botnet)    |
| Complexity  | Simple          | More sophisticated            |
| Impact      | Slower          | More devastating              |
| Mitigation  | Easier          | Requires specialized defense  |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. Real-World Examples of DoS Attacks  

| Year | Attack           | Impact                                                              |
| 2000 | Yahoo DoS Attack | Crashed Yahoo‚Äôs website for hours.                                  |
| 2016 | Dyn DNS Attack   | Slowed down Twitter, Netflix, and PayPal.                           |
| 2023 | Cloudflare DDoS  | Largest-ever HTTPS DDoS attack recorded (71M requests per second).  |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5. How to Prevent DoS Attacks?  

 üõ°Ô∏è 1. Rate-Limiting Requests  
‚úÖ Limit requests per IP using Laravel‚Äôs built-in middleware.  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````php
// In app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $middleware = [
    \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class,
];

// In routes/web.php
Route::middleware('throttle:10,1')->get('/api/data', function () {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Success']);
});
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
> Prevents excessive requests from a single source.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 2. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)  
‚úÖ Cloudflare, AWS WAF, ModSecurity can block attack traffic.  
‚úÖ Blocks bad bots and known attack patterns.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 3. Enable TCP SYN Cookies  
‚úÖ Protects against SYN flood attacks.  
‚úÖ On Linux, enable SYN cookies:  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)  
‚úÖ CDNs like Cloudflare & Akamai absorb attack traffic.  
‚úÖ Distributes requests across multiple servers.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 5. Monitor & Detect Anomalies  
‚úÖ Use fail2ban, Suricata, or Snort to detect unusual traffic patterns.  
‚úÖ Example fail2ban rule:  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````bash
[http-dos]
enabled  = true
port     = http,https
filter   = http-dos
logpath  = /var/log/apache2/access.log
bantime  = 3600
maxretry = 20
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
