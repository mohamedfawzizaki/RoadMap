                                    DDoS Attacks (Distributed Denial of Service) 

 1. What is a DDoS Attack?  

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to overwhelm a server,
 network, or application by flooding it with an excessive amount of requests, causing:  
‚úÖ Slow performance (delayed responses or timeouts).  
‚úÖ Server crashes (unable to handle incoming requests).  
‚úÖ Disruptions in services (websites or APIs become unreachable).  

DDoS attacks are distributed, meaning they come from multiple
 compromised systems (often botnets), making them harder to block.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2. How DDoS Attacks Work
1. Attacker infects multiple devices (computers, IoT devices, etc.) using malware.  
2. Creates a botnet‚Äîa network of infected devices controlled remotely.  
3. Launches an attack by sending a flood of traffic to a target server.  
4. Overwhelms resources, leading to downtime or degraded performance.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3. Types of DDoS Attacks  
DDoS attacks target different layers of a network or application.  

 üîµ 1. Volume-Based Attacks (Layer 3 & 4)
- Floods the target with massive traffic to exhaust bandwidth.  
- Measured in Gbps (Gigabits per second) or PPS (Packets per second).  
- Examples:  
  - UDP Flood: Sends a massive number of UDP packets, consuming bandwidth.  
  - ICMP (Ping) Flood: Sends continuous ping requests to overload the server.  
  - DNS Amplification: Uses vulnerable DNS servers to amplify traffic towards the victim.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üü† 2. Protocol Attacks (Layer 4)
- Exploits weaknesses in network protocols to consume server resources (CPU, memory, firewall limits).  
- Measured in PPS (Packets per second).  
- Examples:  
  - SYN Flood:  
    - Sends half-open TCP connection requests (SYN packets) but never completes them, consuming memory.  
  - ACK Flood:  
    - Sends massive ACK responses to confuse firewalls and servers.  
  - Slowloris Attack:  
    - Opens multiple HTTP connections without closing them, tying up server resources.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üü¢ 3. Application Layer Attacks (Layer 7)
- Targets the web application directly using normal HTTP requests.  
- Harder to detect because it mimics legitimate user traffic.  
- Measured in RPS (Requests per second).  
- Examples:  
  - HTTP Flood:  
    - Sends multiple HTTP requests to overload the web server.  
  - Login Page Attacks:  
    - Floods authentication pages to exhaust resources.  
  - API DDoS Attacks:  
    - Targets API endpoints with thousands of fake API calls.

 4. Real-World DDoS Attack Examples
| Year |      Attack          | Impact                                                        |
| 2016 | Mirai Botnet         | Took down Twitter, Netflix, GitHub by hijacking IoT devices.  |
| 2020 | AWS DDoS Attack      | Largest attack 2.3 Tbps, targeting Amazon Web Services.       |
| 2023 | Google Cloud Attack  | 398 million RPS attack using HTTP/2 Rapid Reset.              |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5. How to Prevent & Mitigate DDoS Attacks
 üõ°Ô∏è 1. Network & Firewall Protection
‚úÖ Rate Limiting: Limit the number of requests per IP.  
‚úÖ Geo-Blocking: Block traffic from high-risk regions.  
‚úÖ Cloud DDoS Protection: Use services like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, Akamai, Imperva.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 2. Web Server & API Protection
‚úÖ CDN (Content Delivery Network): Absorbs traffic spikes and protects origin servers.  
‚úÖ WAF (Web Application Firewall): Blocks malicious Layer 7 requests.  
‚úÖ CAPTCHAs & Bot Detection: Prevents automated traffic.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 3. Traffic Filtering & Load Balancing
‚úÖ Traffic Analysis Tools: Use Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog to detect unusual patterns.  
‚úÖ Load Balancers: Distribute traffic across multiple servers (AWS ELB, Nginx, HAProxy).  
‚úÖ Anycast Routing: Spreads traffic across multiple locations.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 üõ°Ô∏è 4. Linux & Server Hardening
‚úÖ iptables & fail2ban: Block excessive connections from a single IP.  
‚úÖ TCP SYN Cookie: Prevents SYN Flood attacks.  
‚úÖ ModSecurity: Blocks Layer 7 attacks (XSS, SQL Injection).  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6. How to Detect a DDoS Attack
üìå Unusual traffic spikes (high CPU, RAM, or bandwidth usage).  
üìå Slow website response times or timeouts.  
üìå Massive requests from single or multiple unknown IPs.  
üìå Increased failed login attempts.
