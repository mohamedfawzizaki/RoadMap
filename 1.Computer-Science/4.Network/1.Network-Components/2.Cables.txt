                                                   --------
- Definition: 
      - Physical medium that transmits data signals between devices in a network.
- Types:
      1.Twisted Pair:
               - Types: 
                        - Shielded   Twisted Pair (STP): Has shielding to reduce interference.
                        - Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP): Common in Ethernet networks.
               - Categories:
                        - Cat5e     : Supports speeds up to 1 Gbps.
                        - Cat6/Cat6a: Supports higher speeds (up to 10 Gbps).
      2.Coaxial Cable:
               - Used in broadband and older Ethernet networks.
               - Consists of a central conductor, insulating layer, and shielding.
      3.Fiber Optic Cable:
               - Transmits data as light signals.
               - Types:
                        - Single-mode: For long distances.
                        - Multi -mode: For shorter distances.
               - Advantages:
                        - High speed, long distance, and immunity to interference.
- Usage:
      - Twisted pair for LANs.
      - Fiber optics for high-speed internet and backbone networks.
