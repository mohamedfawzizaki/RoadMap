                                                      --------
- Definition: 
      - A network device that connects devices and intelligently forwards
         data to the correct destination based on MAC addresses.
- Types:
      1.Managed   Switch: Provides configuration options and monitoring.
      2.Unmanaged Switch: Simple plug-and-play with no configuration.
- Functions:
      - Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
      - Uses MAC address tables to forward data only to the intended recipient.
      - Reduces collisions compared to hubs.
- Advantages:
      - Faster and more efficient than hubs.
      - Supports VLANs (Virtual LANs) and Quality of Service (QoS).
- Disadvantages:
      - More expensive than hubs.
- Usage:
      - Used in modern LANs for efficient communication.
