                                                      ------
- Definition: 
      - A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a network and forwards data to all connected devices.
- Types:
      1.Active  Hub: Amplifies signals.
      2.Passive Hub: Simply forwards signals without amplification.
- Functions:
      - Operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
      - Broadcasts data packets to all connected devices, leading to potential collisions.
- Advantages:
      - Simple and inexpensive.
- Disadvantages:
      - Inefficient due to broadcasting.
      - Limited scalability.
- Usage:
      - Small, basic networks (less common today due to advances in switches).
