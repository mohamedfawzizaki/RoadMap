                                                   ==========

Definition:
      - A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
      - It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks 
         and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, protecting systems from cyber threats.
      - Acts on Network/Transport layer

Types of Firewalls
      1.Hardware Firewall:
            - A standalone device that protects an entire network.
            - Often used in enterprises for robust network protection.
            - Examples: Cisco ASA, Fortinet FortiGate.

      2.Software Firewall:
            - Installed on individual devices, such as computers or servers.
            - Protects the specific device where it is installed.
            - Examples: Windows Defender Firewall, ZoneAlarm.

      3.Cloud Firewall:
            - Also known as a firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS).
            - Deployed in cloud environments to protect cloud-based systems.
            - Examples: Zscaler, Palo Alto Prisma Cloud.

      4.Network Firewall:
            - Protects an entire network and is deployed at the perimeter.
            - Monitors all inbound and outbound traffic for the network.

      5.Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW):
            - Includes advanced features like deep packet inspection,
              intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and application-level traffic analysis.
            - Capable of detecting modern threats, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs).

      6.Web Application Firewall (WAF):
            - Specifically protects web applications from common vulnerabilities
              like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks.

Functions of a Firewall
      1.Packet Filtering:
            - Examines packets at the network layer and allows or blocks them based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

      2.Stateful Inspection:
            - Keeps track of active connections and ensures packets belong to an existing connection before allowing them.

      3.Proxying:
            - Acts as an intermediary between the user and the external server, hiding the internal network.

      4.Intrusion Detection and Prevention:
            - Monitors for unusual activities and blocks potential attacks.

      5.URL Filtering:
            - Blocks access to specific websites based on URL patterns.

      6.VPN Support:
            - Ensures secure remote connections to the network.

Advantages of Firewalls
      - Protects against unauthorized access.
      - Monitors and controls network traffic.
      - Helps prevent malware and hacking attempts.
      - Can enforce organizational security policies.

Disadvantages of Firewalls
      - Improper configuration can lead to vulnerabilities.
      - High-end firewalls can be expensive.
      - May slow down traffic if overloaded or misconfigured.

Use Cases
      - Enterprises securing their networks from external threats.
      - Homes using routers with built-in firewalls to block malicious websites.
      - Cloud environments for protecting virtual servers.
