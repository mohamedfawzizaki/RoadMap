                                               =======================
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                                1. `/etc/resolv.conf`

This file specifies the DNS servers used by the system to resolve domain names into IP addresses.

Format:
Each line has the format:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            nameserver <DNS server's IP address>
            search     <domain>
            options    <keyword>
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

Directives:
- `nameserver`: 
              - Specifies a DNS server's IP address. Up to three nameservers can be listed.
- `search`: 
              - Defines a search list of domain suffixes. 
              - When a hostname is queried without a domain, the system appends these suffixes.
- `options`: 
              - Allows additional options, such as timeout and retry settings.

Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            nameserver 8.8.8.8
            nameserver 8.8.4.4
            search example.com
            options timeout:2 attempts:3
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - The system queries Googleâ€™s public DNS servers (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`).
  - If you query `webserver`, the system tries `webserver.example.com`.
  - The `timeout` option specifies that the system waits 2 seconds before retrying.
  - The `attempts` option specifies up to 3 retry attempts before failing.

                                                      2. `/etc/hosts`

This file allows manual mapping of hostnames to IP addresses, bypassing DNS queries.

Format:
Each line consists of:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            <IP address> <hostname> [alias...]
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            127.0.0.1   localhost
            192.168.1.10 myserver.local  myserver
            10.0.0.5    webserver.example.com  webserver
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `127.0.0.1 localhost`: 
                  - The loopback IP address is mapped to `localhost`.
  - `192.168.1.10 myserver.local myserver`: 
                  - The private IP `192.168.1.10` is mapped to `myserver.local`, and `myserver` is an alias.
  - `10.0.0.5 webserver.example.com webserver`: 
                  - The IP `10.0.0.5` is mapped to `webserver.example.com`, with `webserver` as a shorthand alias.

                                                    3. `/etc/nsswitch.conf`

This file controls the order in which various name resolution methods are applied. 
It specifies whether the system should first check local files (like `/etc/hosts`) or query DNS.

Relevant Line:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            hosts: files dns
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `files`: The system first checks the `/etc/hosts` file.
  - `dns`: If no match is found in `/etc/hosts`, the system queries DNS servers specified in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                        4. `/etc/network/interfaces` (Debian-based systems)

This file defines network interfaces and can include DNS server settings.

 Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            auto eth0
            iface eth0 inet static
                address 192.168.1.100
                netmask 255.255.255.0
                gateway 192.168.1.1
                dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `dns-nameservers`: Specifies the DNS servers to use for this interface (`eth0`).
  - This configuration is useful for static IP addresses.

                                        5. `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` (systemd-based systems)

For systems using `systemd-resolved`, this file is used to configure DNS settings.

Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            [Resolve]
            DNS=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
            FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
            Domains=example.com
            DNSSEC=yes
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `DNS`: 
          - Specifies the primary DNS servers.
  - `FallbackDNS`: 
          - Specifies fallback DNS servers to use if the primary ones fail.
  - `Domains`: 
          - Appends the specified domain (`example.com`) when a partial hostname is queried.
  - `DNSSEC`: 
          - Enables DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) for secure DNS resolution.

To apply changes, restart `systemd-resolved`:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````bash
            sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                          6. `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`

This file controls how the DHCP client requests IP addresses and DNS information from a DHCP server.

 Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            option domain-name "example.com";
            option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `option domain-name`: Specifies the domain name to use.
  - `option domain-name-servers`: Lists the DNS servers provided by the DHCP server.
  
To apply changes, restart the network interface:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````bash
            sudo dhclient -r eth0
            sudo dhclient eth0
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

                                        7. `/etc/bind/named.conf.options` (for BIND DNS server)

This file is used when configuring a local DNS server using BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain).

 Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            options {
                directory "/var/cache/bind";
                forwarders {
                    8.8.8.8;
                    8.8.4.4;
                };
                dnssec-validation auto;
                listen-on-v6 { any; };
            };
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - `forwarders`: 
          - Specifies external DNS servers for forwarding queries.
  - `dnssec-validation`: 
          - Enables automatic DNSSEC validation.
  - `listen-on-v6`: 
          - Allows the DNS server to listen on any IPv6 address.

                                      8. `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` (for BIND DNS zones)

This file is used to define local DNS zones for the BIND server.

 Example:
            ```````````````````````````````````````````plaintext
            zone "example.com" {
                type master;
                file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
            };
            ```````````````````````````````````````````

- Explanation:
  - This defines a DNS zone for `example.com`, with the zone data stored in `/etc/bind/db.example.com`.
