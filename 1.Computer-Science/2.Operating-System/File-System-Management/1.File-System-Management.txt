                                               File System Management
                                               ====================== 
Definition:
      -> The file system management in an operating 
          system (OS) is a critical aspect of how data is stored, retrieved, and managed on storage devices.
      -> The file system provides an abstraction layer for users
          and applications to interact with data without worrying about the complexities of the underlying hardware.

                                       Key Concepts in File System Management
                                       ====================================== 
1.File:
       - A collection of related data stored on a disk.
       - Files are the smallest unit of storage visible to users.
       - Types of files: 
         - Regular files (text, binary, multimedia).
         - Directories   (folders).
         - Special files (device files, pipes, sockets).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Directory:
       - A container that holds files and subdirectories.
       - Provides a hierarchical structure for organizing files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Path:
       - A string representing the location of a file or directory.
       - Can be absolute (full path from the root) or relative (path from the current working directory).
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
                                            File System Components
                                            ====================== 
1.Logical Structure:
       - Directories:
         - Root directory (`/` in Unix, `C:\` in Windows).
         - Subdirectories organized in a tree structure.
       - File Metadata:
         - Information about a file (e.g., size, permissions, timestamps, ownership).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Physical Structure:
       - Storage Blocks:
         - Files are stored in contiguous or non-contiguous blocks on a disk.
       - File Allocation Table (FAT):
         - A data structure used to manage file allocation on the disk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Mounting:
       - Attaching a file system to the OS's namespace.
       - E.g., mounting a USB drive to a directory.

                                              File Attributes
                                            ======================
Every file has metadata associated with it,
 which includes:

Name       : Identifier of the file.
Type       : File format (e.g., .txt, .jpg).
Location   : Path where the file is stored.
Size       : File size in bytes.
Permissions: Access rights (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others.
Timestamp  : Creation, modification, and last access time.

                                            File System Operations
                                            ======================
The OS provides the following operations to manage files and directories:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.File Operations:
       - Create    : Allocate space and metadata for a new file.
       - Open      : Load file metadata into memory for use.
       - Read/Write: Access or modify file content.
       - Close     : Release resources associated with an open file.
       - Delete    : Remove the file and its metadata from the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Directory Operations:
       - Create/Delete: Add or remove directories.
       - List         : Display contents of a directory.
       - Traverse     : Navigate the directory hierarchy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Metadata Operations:
       - Retrieve or modify file attributes like size, permissions, and timestamps.

                                            File Allocation Methods
                                            =======================
The method used to allocate disk space for files affects performance and reliability:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Contiguous Allocation:
       - All file blocks are stored together in consecutive locations.
       - Pros: Fast read/write.
       - Cons: Fragmentation, resizing issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Linked Allocation:
       - Each file block contains a pointer to the next block.
       - Pros: No fragmentation.
       - Cons: Slower access, reliability issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Indexed Allocation:
       - A separate index block contains pointers to all file blocks.
       - Pros: Fast random access.
       - Cons: Overhead for index storage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Clustered Allocation:
       - Combines contiguous and linked allocation for balance.

                                            File System Structure
                                            =======================
A typical file system consists of multiple layers:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boot Block
Contains boot code, which is executed when the system starts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Superblock
Holds metadata about the file system, such as total size, number of blocks, block size, and free block count.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inode Table
An inode (index node) stores information about a file, including its size, owner, permissions, and data block pointers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Blocks
The actual content of files is stored in data blocks.

      Others  : All other users on the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Access Control Lists (ACLs)
      Provide finer-grained control over file permissions by specifying access rights for individual users or groups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Encryption
      Files can be encrypted to protect their contents from unauthorized access.

                                            File System Backup and Recovery
                                            ===============================

Backup     : Creating copies of data to prevent data loss.
Recovery   : Restoring data from backups in case of hardware failure or accidental deletion.

Common backup methods:
      Full Backup        :  Copies all files.
      Incremental Backup :  Copies only files that have changed since the last backup.
      Differential Backup:  Copies files that have changed since the last full backup.

                                               File System Hierarchy
                                               =====================
In Unix/Linux systems, the file system hierarchy is standardized as:
                           _____________________________________________________
                           | Directory | Purpose                                 |
                           |-----------|-----------------------------------------|    
                           | `/`       | Root directory.                         |
                           | `/home`   | User home directories.                  |
                           | `/var`    | Variable files (logs, spools).          |

                                               File System Structure
                                               =====================
Defifnition:
      -> A file system is a critical component of an operating
         system (OS) that manages how data is stored, organized, and accessed on storage devices.
      -> The file system structure refers to the logical layers and components that enable efficient data management.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.Overall File System Layout

The structure of a typical file system consists of the following components:

         1.Boot Block
         2.Superblock
         3.Inode Table
         4.Data Blocks
         5.Directory Structure
         6.Free Space Management
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2.Components of the File System Structure

      1.Boot Block
         - Located at the beginning of the storage medium.
         - Contains the boot loader, which is responsible for loading the OS kernel into memory.
         - Not directly related to file storage but essential for system startup.
         - Only the first partition or volume usually has a boot block.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      2.Superblock
         - A vital part of the file system containing metadata about the file system.
         - Typically includes:
            - Total size of the file system.
            - Block size (unit of data storage).
            - Total number of inodes.
            - Free block count.
            - Free inode count.
            - File system state (e.g., clean or dirty).
         - The superblock is critical for mounting the file system and performing file system operations.
         - If the superblock is corrupted, the file system can become unmountable, though backup copies of the superblock are often maintained.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      3.Inode Table
         - An inode (index node) is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory.
         - Each file has a unique inode, which contains:
            - File type (regular file, directory, symbolic link, etc.).
            - File size.
            - Permissions (read, write, execute for owner, group, others).
            - Owner and group ID.
            - Timestamps (creation, last modification, last access).
            - Link count (number of references to the file).
            - Pointers to data blocks where the file's content is stored.
      Inodes do not store the file name; instead, file names are stored in directories, which map file names to inode numbers.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
      4.Data Blocks
         - Data blocks store the actual content of files.
         - The size of a block is typically fixed (e.g., 4 KB) and is determined during file system creation.
         - A file may span multiple data blocks, and pointers in the inode link to these blocks.
         - If a file is small, it may occupy only a portion of a block, leading to internal fragmentation.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      5.Directory Structure
         - Directories are special files that store mappings between file names and inode numbers.
         - The directory structure forms a hierarchical tree with the root directory (`/`) at the top.
         - Example of a simple directory hierarchy:
                                                   /
                                                   ├── home
                                                   │   ├── user1
                                                   │   └── user2
                                                   ├── bin
                                                   ├── etc
                                                   └── var
         - Each entry in a directory contains:
            - File name.
            - Inode number of the file.
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      6.Free Space Management
         - The file system maintains a list of free blocks available for file storage.
         - Common methods for free space management:
      1.Bitmaps:  
               - A bitmap is an array where each bit represents a block.
               - A bit set to `0` indicates a free block, while a bit set to `1` indicates an allocated block.
      2.Free Block List:  
               - A linked list of free blocks.
               - Each free block contains a pointer to the next free block.

                                                   File System Journaling
                                                   ======================
What is Journaling?
      
      -> Journaling is a technique used by modern file systems to maintain a log (or journal) 
          of changes that will be made to files and directories.
      
      -> This is done to ensure that the file system can recover to a 
          consistent state in the event of a system crash or power failure.
      
      -> When a file system is "journaling," it writes changes to a special log 
          before making the actual changes to the file system.
      
      -> This log helps the file system avoid corruption and ensures data integrity during unexpected shutdowns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Journaling Works:
      
      - Journal Log    : The file system maintains a journal (a dedicated area on the disk)
                          where it records metadata about file system operations, such as creating, deleting, or modifying files.
      
      - Commit Process : Before applying changes to the file system (like modifying or deleting a file), 
                          the file system first writes a description of the changes to the journal.
                         After the change is safely written to the journal, the actual file system is updated.
      
      - Recovery       : If the system crashes or there is an unexpected shutdown, 
                          the journal can be reviewed to see which operations were interrupted.
                         The file system can then "replay" the journal, completing 
                          any operations that were in progress, ensuring that the system can recover to a consistent state.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of Journaling:
      
      - Data Integrity    : The journal ensures that changes are recorded before they are applied, 
                              preventing partial writes and ensuring the file system can recover gracefully.
      
      - Faster Recovery   : In case of a crash, only the journal needs to be checked and replayed 
                              (as opposed to running a full file system check), resulting in faster recovery times.
      
      - Minimal Data Loss : While journaling doesn't guarantee zero data loss, 
                              it significantly reduces the chances of data corruption and loss.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Journaling:
      1.Metadata Journaling: 
                - Only metadata (information about files such as their names, permissions, timestamps, and locations) is logged.
                - This is the most common approach, as it offers a balance between performance and reliability.
                - It does not guarantee the integrity of file data itself.
                - Example: ext3, ext4 file systems (Linux).
         
      2.Full Data Journaling:
                - Both the file data and metadata are written to the journal.
                - This offers the highest level of reliability, but it can have a performance overhead.
                - Example: JFS (IBM's Journaled File System), XFS (though XFS can also operate in a mode with only metadata journaling).

      3.Ordered Journaling: 
                - A hybrid approach where only metadata changes are journaled,
                   but in a specific order that ensures the consistency of the file data.
                - This balances reliability and performance.
                - Example: ext4 (with ordered mode).

      Journaling File Systems Examples:
               - ext3/ext4 (Linux)  : Both file systems support metadata journaling (ext4 also supports full data journaling with the `journal` option).
               - XFS (Linux)        : Provides a journaling feature, optimized for high-performance and large-scale data storage.
               - NTFS (Windows)     : NTFS uses journaling to protect metadata.Full data journaling is also possible with specific configurations.
               - ReiserFS (Linux)   : A journaling file system that offers high performance for handling small files.

                                               File System Backup and Recovery
                                               ===============================
Backup:
        -> A file system backup is a process of copying data (files, directories, configurations) 
            from the primary storage to a secondary medium (such as an external drive, cloud storage, or remote server)
            for the purpose of data protection.
        -> Backups can be performed periodically to safeguard against data loss, accidental deletion, or hardware failure.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of File System Backups:
         1.Full Backup:
               - A complete copy of all data, including files, directories, and system settings.
               - Pros: Simplifies recovery, as it contains everything.
               - Cons: Time-consuming and requires significant storage space.

         2.Incremental Backup:
               - Only the files that have changed since the last backup are copied.
               - Pros: Faster and requires less storage space.
               - Cons: Recovery is slower, as all incremental backups since the last full backup need to be restored.

         3.Differential Backup:
               - Copies all the files that have changed since the last full backup.
               - Pros: Faster recovery than incremental backups, as it only requires the last full backup and the last differential backup.
               - Cons: Takes more storage than incremental backups, but less than a full backup.

         4.Mirror Backup:
               - Creates an exact copy (mirror) of the source data, including all directories and files.
               - Pros: Provides an exact copy of the data.
               - Cons: Does not support versioningو If a file is deleted or modified, it will be reflected in the backup.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backup Methods:
    - Local Backup  : Backing up data to an external storage device (e.g., external hard drives, DVDs).
    - Cloud Backup  : Backing up data to remote servers (cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
    - Network Backup: Storing backups over a local area network (LAN) to a network-attached storage (NAS) device.
    - Tape Backup   : Using magnetic tape to back up large volumes of data.
                      Tape backups are commonly used in enterprise environments for archiving.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Backup Tools:
    - rsync (Linux)  : A powerful tool for backing up data with options for incremental backups and remote backup over SSH.
    - tar (Linux)    : Commonly used for creating full backups by archiving files into a single compressed file.
    - Acronis (Windows, Linux, macOS): A proprietary backup tool offering full, incremental, and differential backups with scheduling options.
    - Veeam (Windows, Linux)         : A backup and disaster recovery solution for virtualized environments.

Recovery:
       -> Recovery refers to the process of restoring data from a backup after data loss, corruption, or failure.
       -> It can involve restoring files, system states, or entire disk partitions from backup sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery Scenarios:
      1.File Recovery:
            - Restoring specific files or directories from backup.
            - Example: A user accidentally deletes a file, and the file is restored from the latest backup.

      2.System Recovery:
            - Restoring the system to a previous working state using system restore points or full disk image backups.
            - Example: A system crash occurs, and the operating system and applications are restored from a system image backup.

      3.Disaster Recovery:
            - Involves the recovery of data after a catastrophic failure, such as disk failure, hardware issues, or security breach.
            - Example: A business loses its database server to a failure, and the data is restored from off-site backup storage.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery Methods:
      - File-Level Recovery : Restoring individual files or directories.
      - Block-Level Recovery: Recovering data at the block level, useful for large files or full system recovery.
      - Bare-Metal Recovery : Recovering an entire system (including operating system, applications, and settings) to a new hardware or disk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery Tools:
      - TestDisk (Linux, Windows, macOS)    : A free tool used to recover lost partitions and make non-booting disks bootable again.
      - Clonezilla (Linux, Windows)         : An open-source tool for disk cloning and backup recovery.
      - Windows Backup and Restore (Windows): Built-in tool for creating and restoring system images and file backups.
      - Time Machine (macOS)                : Apple's built-in backup and recovery tool for macOS.
